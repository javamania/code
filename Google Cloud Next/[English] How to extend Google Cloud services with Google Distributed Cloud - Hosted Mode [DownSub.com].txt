ANDY QIN: Hello, everyone.

Welcome to APP 101 breakout.

Today we'd like to
introduce Google Distributed

Cloud, Hosting Mode.

My name is Andy Qin,
I'm a product manager

in Google Cloud.

I'm here with my colleague Ray.

RAY COLLINE: Hi there.

I'm Ray Colline.

And I'm a software engineer,
who works on Google Cloud.

And it's great to be here.



ANDY QIN: In this
session, we'll first

look at market pain points,
and the limitations of existing

solutions.

And then we will
introduce Google solution

in terms of how it's
defined, and what's

the key streams and
the characteristics.

And we will then dive
deep into the product

areas, like platform,
services, and support.



Today the public clouds provide
amazing results and benefits.

So it seems everything is
moving to public Cloud.

But the reality is
that not all workloads

can move to public Cloud
for different reasons,

regulatory, IP protection,
sovereignty concerns.

Those workloads that
stayed private, it's

very challenging
for them to leverage

all the cool innovation
from Cloud technologies

to empower their business,
and, oftentimes, those

are very special and specific
part of their business.

As we in public clouds
the infrastructure

is quite transparent.

Users do not need to care about
the gory details of things

like hardware operation.

However, that's not the
case for private Cloud.

In the legacy private
Cloud customers

still have to
spend a lot of time

managing their infrastructure.

And most hobbyists pinpointed
that customers will end up

with a public Cloud
and private Cloud

with different development
models and toolings,

and the resulted inconsistency
impacts business agility.



The market pain
points are very clear,

but if you look at the
existing solutions out

in the marketplace they didn't
address all those pain points.

As we know, some products are
viewed on proprietary stack.

There's no consistency between
that and the public Cloud.

Applications developed in
private mode cannot be easily

ported to the public Cloud.

It's very difficult
to achieve write once,

and run anywhere [INAUDIBLE].

Some private Cloud products
a very infrastructure service

oriented.

No advanced Cloud innovations
like AI/ML services and data

analytics.

And the management
methodologies are very legacy.

For example, the more
declarative policy paradigm

is quite common in public
Cloud, but most private

Cloud are still using
the legacy imperative

tools to match their systems.

Some private Cloud products
do meet most requirements.

However, they require
connections back

to their Cloud region for the
quintupling to even function.

This poses a huge challenge
for sensitive workloads,

especially in the
specific market segments,

like defense and
critical infrastructure.



Google Cloud recognizes
those market pain points

and the clear gaps
in the marketplace.

We are going to offer a
solution that can directly

solve those challenges.

The solution is called Google
Distributed Cloud Hosted Mode.

There's three key things to
highlight on this solution.

First, it doesn't
require connections back

to public Cloud.

All quintupling, data plane,
match plane can be local.

It helps you meet
the sovereignty

and the regulatory requirements.

Second, it comes with
highly differentiated

advanced services, like
AI/ML and the data analytics.

We believe those services
are critical to empower

the customer to stay
competitive in their own market.

And the third, it leverages
open source and open API.

This provides an automated
portability and software

survivability, which are super
important to both business

agility and the
sovereignty needs.

At this particular
point in time,

the Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode

is still a pre-GA product.

We are working hard to bring
this to the market soon.



Besides the three
key things, I think

it's important to look
at the characteristics

and the key strengths of Google
Distributed Cloud Hosted Mode.

The name Hosted Mode tells a
lot about location and control.

The solution can be deployed
at a customer designated data

center, even in the totally
air gapped environment.

This solution is not just
the infrastructure play,

it comes with Google advanced
services, like AI/ML.

The power of those technologies
and Google's years of expertise

are no longer limited
to the public Cloud,

with Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode,

customers can now enjoy
those on their own premise.

Another strength
worth highlighting

is that the entire
solution is flexible.

It comes as pre-assembled
and preconfigured racks

and is delivered to your
data center as a service.

It can scale from 1
rack, to a couple racks,

and to hundreds of racks.

It has local
quintupling built in,

so it covers all sovereignty
dimensions, data sovereignty,

operational sovereignty,
and software sovereignty.

While it's built
by Google Cloud,

so it inherits the Cloud DNA.

Open and the Modern are
the design philosophies

we follow when we
build the solution.

We believe the solution
will meet the needs of many

industries, where they have
a sensitive workload and they

cannot move to the public Cloud,
but they still want to leverage

the modern innovation
from Cloud.

Public sector is a prime
example of those industries.

With that, let me
invite my colleague

Ray to talk about what
exactly is in the solution

and what are the
key capabilities.

RAY COLLINE: Thank you, Andy.

We're going to get into a little
bit of the technology that

makes up Google distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode.

And we'll start with the
lowest level, the hardware.

So at Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode

is full racks of hardware
optimized to deliver

an air gapped Cloud experience.

These racks include
modern hardware

from top OEM providers,
including HPE, NetApp,

and Cisco.

All of the
infrastructure management

is taken care of by
Google Distributed Cloud.

These are things like
operating system upgrades,

firmware upgrades, switch OS
upgrades, NetApp upgrades,

et cetera.

All are taken care of as part
of Google Distributed Cloud.

It also includes GPUs
for AI/ML workloads.

And it includes storage block--

or sorry, block, file,
and object storage

in a redundant manner.

It also includes high
performance networking.

And in fact, each node
has full bandwidth

to all the other nodes
within a GDC instance,

and these instances can
be up to 10,000 VCPUs.

In addition, it's
Kubernetes all the way down.

So Andy spoke earlier
about it being open, right?

We've taken that and we've
introduced Kubernetes APIs

all the way down into the
infrastructure management layer

so that the notion
of an OS upgrade

is actually controlled through
the reliability of Kubernetes.



Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode

is a full air gapped
Cloud solution stand alone

from any other Cloud,
and so it comes

with sophisticated
multi-tendency.

As we know in public
clouds things like GCP

have the notion of
organizations and projects,

and one creates a project
before doing anything on GPC,

creating a VM, creating a
cluster, creating a database.

Within Amazon, one creates an
account to do the same thing.

Well, GDC introduces the notion
of fleets and fleet namespaces

to provide that level of
resource management and tenancy

within a GPC instance.

Fleets are hardware
separated from each other,

allowing a single GPC instance
to serve multiple applications

with good security
guarantees between them.

And fleet namespaces,
like Amazon accounts

and GCP projects,
provide isolation

between teams and
components of applications.

Policy control is built
in from the beginning.

As we said earlier, we're
Kubernetes all the way down.

So all the APIs benefit from
having Anthos policy controller

based on OPA gatekeeper,
and Kubernetes emission

control, such that one
can govern all aspects

of the usage, and also audit.

This means you could,
for example, take a VM

and say no VMs can ever
have the name Ray in it,

and we could enforce such a
policy at that granularity.

It's also extensible
and customizable.

So Kubernetes APIs allow
for custom controllers

to do any sorts of things.

We've had customers
build controllers

that disallow
launching of new code

unless there's an
associated launch

process that's been approved.

And Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode

is a rich and open ecosystem.

Because it's built on
standard Kubernetes,

one could use the entire
community of software

available to operate
Kubernetes within GPC.



GDC comes with much
security and confidentiality

features built in.

A local certificate
authority backed by an HSM

is provided out of the box.

This allows GDC to meet FIPS
140-2 level 3 compliance.

In addition, GDC
can be configured

to work with an existing HSM
provided by the customer.

Secrets management is provided
using the common secrets API,

but it's backed by the
HSM to make it secure.

Also, GDC benefits from
Google's investment

in making GKE secure, and
all of the enhancements put

into GKE so far, plus
Google's contributions

into the Kubernetes community.

Identity and access
management is

supported using standard
protocols like OADC and SAML

2.0, meaning it
can be configured

to work with existing
identity providers

that our customers have.

And because it's Kubernetes
all the way down,

every aspect of the system
is managed by Kubernetes role

based access control.

If you know GCPE,
you will understand

that IM is it's part of every
control surface within Google

Cloud platform.

Well within Google
Distributed Cloud,

Kubernetes RBAC performs and
operates at that same level,

providing fine-grained
control over all resources.

Additionally, supply chain
security, a top concern,

is something that
we've been working hard

both on the hardware
and software side.

We've been working with Tier
1 providers in each region,

and we require strong
hardware supply chain security

as part of the GCD OEM process.

Additionally, the GKE and
our Google security teams

have been ensuring software
supply chain security

in the Kubernetes OSS
stacks for years and years.

And we've made
many contributions

to making Kubernetes a
safe, reliable system

to run workloads on.

And lastly, everything you do
or perform on Google Distributed

Cloud Hosted Mode is audited.

And these audit logs are
compliant with the NIST 853

standards.



Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode

comes with a
variety of services.

And because it's
built on Kubernetes,

anything out in the
open source community

that runs on
Kubernetes will also

run on Google Distributed Cloud.

We are also working with
third party OEM providers

to provide enterprise versions
of popular open source

packages enabling first
class support and enterprise

features.



Lastly, I'm going to chat
about operations and support,

a key concern when
operating a Cloud.

Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode

has a few different
operational patterns

to support customer needs,
which Andy will cover later.

But importantly, the bring
up in deployment of GDC

will be facilitated by
Google every step of the way.

As mentioned earlier, all
the operational aspects

are provided and
operated by Google,

meaning that
customers do not have

to worry about patching and OS
upgrades, BIOS, firmware, CVE

response, et cetera, et cetera.

Instead, Google makes
this largely push button,

or can even provide the
support and operations

to do that for you.

Additionally, the
ability to support an air

gapped deployments,
Google engineering

is ensuring that
every area comes

with full detailed support
and training resources.

As an anecdote within the
engineering organization

for GDC, any pull
request that's submitted

must come with metadata for
support operations, which

makes engineers think
about the full lifecycle

up front, providing
a higher reliability

and operable system.

And regarding
support, Google GDC

can be used and trusted in
air gapped environments.

Google has developed
new support techniques

and operational techniques
derived from Google SRE best

practices, allowing GDC to
maintain a reliable SLO,

while also providing
trusted user

support without requiring any
data to leave the GDC instance.

Importantly for all
operations, Google

is the only vendor a
customer has to call.

And lastly,
localized management.

So in addition to local UI,
local APIs, control plane,

everything being on as
part of the GDC instance

in air gapped or
other environments,

documentation and
access to support

is also built in,
meaning that users do not

need any outside access
to operate and use GDC.

Now, in rare cases, if
the customer desires

faster support, we
will offer a way

to send sanitized
logs, so they could

be shared with the core
engineering teams, increasing

support turnaround.

With that, I'm going to
pass the baton back to Andy.

Thank you very much.

ANDY QIN: Thank you, Ray.

To sum it up, Google
Distributed Cloud Hosted Mode

gives you the power of Cloud
innovation with control.

And it covers all
aspects of sovereignty.

Data is on customer premise
or any data center designated

by the customer.

It can be operated by a customer
directly or by an operating

partner that has the right
credentials and the trust

from the end customer.

Google will train
and work closely

with those chosen partners
to ensure the service

availability.

In certain scenarios, Google
can also operate the deployment

directly with cleared and
certified operational teams.

Its build with
open API, and means

a lot when customers
want to ensure

business continuity in any
potential black swan events.

And it definitely helps
to meet local government's

regulatory requirements.



Google Distributed
Cloud Hosted Mode--

RAY COLLINE: --the benefits
of Cloud delivered locally.

ANDY QIN: This
concludes our session.

Thank you for listening.

Thank you, Ray, for being
part of this conversation.

RAY COLLINE: Thank you
for having me, Andy.

And I hope all of you have a
great rest of the time at Next.
