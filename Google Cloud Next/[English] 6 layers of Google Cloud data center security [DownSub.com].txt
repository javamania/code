STEPHANIE WONG: Hi,
everyone, and welcome.

I hope you're enjoying
Google Cloud Next '21.

I know this is
another virtual year.

But I'm hoping that today, I get
to bring some of my experiences

to life for you.

I'm going to be
talking about what

it was like to explore the six
layers of Google Cloud data

center security.

Now, you might be thinking of
lasers, night vision cameras,

and military-grade fences.

You're not too far
off because security

is one of the most critical
elements of our data center's

DNA and Google Cloud workloads.

With dozens of data
centers globally,

security operations
means managing

a massively complex network.

I was one of the rare
Googlers to visit one.

So I'm going to take
you on a journey

to the core of a data
center to show you

the six layers of
physical security designed

to thwart unauthorized access.

But first, I'll touch on Google
Cloud security philosophy

before I take you on that
journey to the core of the data

center.

And then we'll
touch on how you can

leverage that same
philosophy on Google Cloud.

And it's great to be here today.

My name is Stephanie Wong.

I'm a Cloud developer advocate.

And I've been creating
developer-focused content

for the last four
years or so here.

Of course, when I got the
chance to visit a data center

and make a film about it, I
jumped at the opportunity.

So let's go ahead and
dive right into it.

So in terms of
transparency, we're

very clear about our commitments
to customers about your data.

Rule number one-- your data
belongs to you, no one else.

We do not sell customer
data to third parties,

nor do we use it
for advertising.

Your data is your data.

Your data is also encrypted in
transit and at rest all times.

And you do not have
to ask for that.

And if you want, we
can give you ways

to add additional
encryption on top of that.

We also have explicit rules to
guard against insider access.

There is no back door to Google.

There's no secret
government access.

We take pride in our
international audits.

And we deliver
results on request.

These are the most
important roles

in our mission of
digital transformation.

It's giving you the trust that
you need to build great things.

So how can Google Cloud
help organizations

with their security?

Well, first, we provide
protection from threats

through a secure foundation
core infrastructure

that is designed, built, and
operated with security in mind.

Second, we provide customers
with a constantly expanding

array of controls
that they can use

to help meet policy, regulatory,
and business objectives.

And third, we work to meet our
compliance responsibilities

and provide capabilities
to make compliance easier

for customers.

But first, let's talk
about the protection

that you get from building on
our infrastructure foundation.

Our infrastructure doesn't
rely on any single technology

to make it secure.

Rather, we build security
through progressive layers that

deliver true defense in depth.

So our hardware is
Google-controlled, built,

and hardened.

Any application binary that
runs on our infrastructure

is deployed securely.

We do not assume any
trust between services.

And we use multiple mechanisms
to establish and maintain

trust.

Our infrastructure
was designed to be

multi-tenant from the start.

All identities,
users, and services

are strongly authenticated.

Data stored on
our infrastructure

is automatically
encrypted at rest

and distributed for
availability and reliability.

Any communications over the
internet to our Cloud Services

are also encrypted.

And the scale of
our infrastructure

allows us to absorb many
denial of service attacks.

We have multiple
layers of protection

that further reduce the
risk of any DDoS impact.

And finally, our operations
teams detect threats

and respond to incidents
24/7, 365 days a year.

We actually have a white paper
written on our infrastructure

design that goes into all
of these areas in much

more detail.

Other cloud providers might
describe a similar stack

of capabilities.

But the way that Google Cloud
approaches many of these,

in my opinion, is very unique.

So I had the chance to
visit a data center in 2019.

And I made a video
about my experience

that you should all check out.

I'll be sure to share the link.

But you can find it
at bit.ly/6layersdeep.

This was a huge project.

And it wasn't easy to
get approvals or even

step foot inside the premises.

But in my job at
Google, I spend my days

working with developers.

Our data centers are crucial
to the work that they do.

But most never actually set
foot inside a data center.

So as you can see here, there
is a huge amount of space

that our data centers span,
352,000 square feet, or 33,000

square meters.

And all in all, less
than 1% of Googlers

ever get to set foot inside.

So I was determined to make a
video because for close to two

decades, Google
has designed data

centers from the ground up.

Security has surfaced as one
of the most critical elements

of our DNA.

And it's part of our commitment
to keep our customers'

data safe, and not to
mention Google Cloud

now meets more than 45
regulatory requirements,

and growing.

Our products regularly undergo
independent verification

of their security, privacy,
and compliance controls,

achieving certifications,
attestations of compliance,

or audit reports against
these global standards.

This means that an
independent auditor

has examined the controls
present in our data centers,

infrastructure, and operations.

These certifications include
some of the most widely

recognized, internationally
accepted independent security

standards, including ISO/IEC
27001 for security controls,

ISO/IEC 27017 for
Cloud Security,

and ISO/IEC 27018
for cloud privacy

as well as AICP SOC 1, 2, and 3.

These certifications
are helping us

meet the demands of
the industry standards,

like CSA STAR and
PCI DSS as well

as many other regional
standards as well.

We continue to expand our
list of compliance offerings

globally to assist our
customers with their compliance

obligations.

So while auditors can sometimes
enter our data centers

to perform these audits, most
people, including Googlers,

cannot.

Under special
authorization, I found out

that our physical
data center security

is built using that defense
in depth foundation.

It's made up of six
layers, from the exterior

all the way to the center,
each increasing in controls

as you get to layer 6.

So I'm going to walk
through each layer and some

of the most notable
features and experiences

that I went through.

So let's start with layer 1.

This is the secure perimeter.

Basically, it means the
property boundaries.

And that includes all
the signage and fencing

around the property.

These are the furthest, most
exterior edges of the property.

So as you drive
into the property,

you'll see signs that might
have a Google logo or a signage.

But otherwise, you really
can't tell immediately

that's-- it's a data center.

It's, more or less--

looks like an industrial
area or a business park.

But things really start
to get interesting

when it comes to layer 2, also
known as the secure perimeter.

And that includes the
main entrance gate.

So I started my
journey by driving up

to this gate, at
which point I needed

my credentials and
my identity checked.

Even before stepping foot
into the property boundaries,

I was already on an
access approval list.

The least privileged
protocol is the idea

that someone should have only
the bare minimum privileges

necessary to perform their job.

So if your least privilege
is to enter layer 2,

then you're not going to
have luck moving to layer 3.

Each person's access
and permissions

are checked at badge readers,
starting with layer 1,

and progresses more
stringently at layer 6.

These exist at every access
point in the data center

facility.

And authorization
measures happen everywhere

using this protocol.

This is something that we don't
just employ in a data center,

but it's also a best
practice we always

recommend for how you set up
your organization resources

and data on Google Cloud.

So as you know, applying
least privilege to IAM roles

on Google Cloud is recommended.

So any user has the bare minimum
roles and their permissions

to perform their functions.

So layer 2 has a lot
of security features,

ranging from smart fencing
to overlapping cameras

to 24/7 guard patrols and more.

And there's actually
a lot more technology

and operations going on behind
the scenes than meets the eye.

So from the time
that you're on-site,

they already know
that you're there.

But what I found
also interesting

is that they're able to do
correlation analysis of where

you've been on site through
cameras, badge access

tracking, et cetera.

And there are also
guards in vehicles

and some guards on foot.

As you can see here, there's
also the vehicle crash barrier.

This is designed to stop a
fully loaded truck from crashing

through the front entrance.

This particular black fence
also that you see here

is an anti-climb fence.

So there are spikes
pointed outward.

It'd be pretty hard to get
over that in one piece.

It's also equipped with fiber.

The technology tells data
center security operations

if someone's near the
fence or touches the fence.

They also use thermal
cameras and standard cameras

so that they're able to see
video footage at night just

as clearly as they
can during the day.

Each camera overlaps the
area that it can cover.

So there's no blind
spots anywhere

around the data center.

Now, you might be
wondering, well,

what if somebody skydives
into the property

or digs under the ground?

Trust me, they have enough
coverage of the area

that they will detect
something coming

into the property
or motion that's

occurring near the fence.

These are not only
physical safeguards,

but act as a big
deterrent to anyone

even thinking about trying
to forcibly come inside.

And more obstacles
await them inside.

And we have additional
operational monitoring

happening in any case that
will alert more guards

to take action if
they detect something.

Layer 3 is building access.

In this case, I was
able to enter the lobby.

But just so you
know, this is still

nowhere near the
data center floor

because that's still a
few more layers deep.

So let's say that you've
gotten through the gate,

you've come inside, you've
come into the secured lobby,

and you have your card or a
form of identification, which

is checked by a receptionist
to make sure that you're

on the access control list.

But what happens if
you lose your card?

Then what?

For that reason, biometric
scanning is also employed.

So, yes, I did have to
get my irises scanned.

Similar to concepts in
software development,

biometric scanning is for
authentication of identity.

Meanwhile, my badge allowing
access to a certain area

is authorization.

Yes, this also felt
like I was on some sort

of secret top mission, maybe
"Mission Impossible" or maybe

"Ocean's Eleven"
or, more recently,

I've been hearing it's
been compared to Professor

from "Money Heist."

But once that was taken
care of, another rule

exists at the data
center that prevents

a vehicle or an
individual closely

following another to gain
entry into a restricted area

without a badge swipe.

So if the system detects
a door open for too long,

it immediately alerts
security personnel.

Any gate or door must close
before the next vehicle

or the person can badge
in and then gain access.

You've probably seen
dual authentication

when you try to
sign into an account

and you get a one-time
password sent to your phone.

We take a similar
approach at the data

centers to verify a person's
identity and access.

At some layers in
the data center,

you're required to
swipe your badge

and then enter a circle
lock or a tubular doorway.

You walk into this
special half-portal

that checks your badge and
scans your eyes to gain access

to the next layer
of the data center.

It prevents anyone from
closely following you

through because only one person
is allowed into the circle lock

at a time.

So you can see here that I
have to first badge, then

step inside, get
my irises scanned,

and then it verifies my identity
and the door on the other side

unlocks.

And something not shown
in the video that I made

is the facility loading
docks, which are

a special section of layer 3.

They're used to receive and
send shipments of materials,

like new hardware.

Truck deliveries from vendors
must be approved for access

to layer 3 to enter the dock.

For security, the
loading dock room

is physically isolated from
the rest of the data center.

And a guard is present--

a guard presence
is required when

a shipment is received or sent.

I actually got super lucky
when I was there and got

to witness shipments being made
of new servers being delivered.

And in order for them
to even get to layer 3,

they had to have been on
the allowed access list

through layers 1 and 2
before arriving at layer 3.

Guards checked their
identification and the access

list before letting them into
layer 2 and, subsequently,

opening the garage door to let
them back up into the loading

dock room.

Then out came fresh new
server racks, one by one.

And once unloading was
complete, the vendor left

and the hardware
operations team began

to move the racks into layer
4 by badging themselves in,

one at a time, with the actual
hardware going into the data

center.

Badge checks occur
at every entry point

throughout the
facility to ensure

least privilege is adhered to.

Even timed
authorizations happen.

So you can do your job for only
an allotted amount of time.

So this could apply to loading
docks or even performing

hardware maintenance on
the data center floor.

You're probably thinking
of your favorite movie,

wondering, what if supply
chain gets intercepted?

Well, additional checks happen
for this potential risk.

And we have tested for
many potential risk

scenarios, which I'll talk
about in a little bit.

Layer 4 is once you've actually
entered the data center itself.

And this includes an extremely
important part of data center

security, the Security
Operations Center, or SOC,

a hive of activity that's
monitoring the data

center 24/7, 365 days a year.

The doors, the cameras, the
badge readers, iris scan--

everything is
monitored from here.

Anyone on site at
the facility will

have their movement patterns
tracked throughout the property

via their badge
and biometric scans

at entry points and doors.

If a door is kept open for
too long or correlation

analysis finds that
their presence is

in an unauthorized location,
alerts will be sent to the SOC

instantly.

This is the brains of
the security system.

So if there's anything out
of the ordinary happening,

they have to be able
to pick that up.

The SOCs of all
Google data centers

are also designed to
roll up to a regional SOC

for multi-regional
high-availability purposes.

If an on-site SOC
were to be disrupted

due to an event, such as a
natural disaster or emergency

building evacuation,
monitoring instantly

rolls over to the regional SOC
for continuous, uninterrupted

monitoring.

SOCs act as a center
for emergency and safety

response in addition to
security responsibilities.

These SOCs monitor
and respond to alarms

at all of our facilities
and are constantly

tracking local and global events
that could impact operations

at our data centers.

Think of this like
high availability

for physical security.

And really, that also means
it's high availability

for logical security and
data protection as well.

Layer 5 is the
data center floor.

Servers and network equipment
that power Google live here.

Security in this layer is one
of the most highly restrictive,

as it's where the data resides.

And this meant I needed
to enter a circle lock,

get my irises scanned
and badge checked.

And then once in there, I
was accompanied by our guards

in every space.

And the VP of global
data centers, Joe Kava,

took me around.

So only hardware operations
personnel, security

professionals, and
key people granted

access on an as-needed
basis can enter.

Access is limited to the
time required to complete

the necessary job function.

So this is truly an
as-needed-only access area,

meaning that only the
technicians and engineers that

have to be there to
maintain, upgrade, or repair

the equipment are
ever allowed there.

This layer is protected by a
circle lock, as I mentioned,

security staff, and
badge-protected doors.

And the data center floor
features laser beam intrusion

detection.

Additional cameras are also
placed throughout the area

while security staff monitor the
data center floor at all times.

And the technicians who
have access to the devices

are there.

But the data at
rest is encrypted.

And you can also issue and
keep your own encryption keys.

And if you're
wondering, Googlers

do not have access to the data
unless you've authorized it

for a technical issue.

And this is called
access transparency,

which is a technical control.

It produces immutable logs any
time a Google administrator

needs to enter a customer's
tenant to perform something,

whether it's a support
request or maintenance.

And you control what types of
access that you want to permit.

For example, maintenance is OK.

Support's not, or it's OK for a
given set of your environment.

So layer 6 is disk destroyal
or, as I like to call it,

hard drive graveyard.

So Google employs a
strict equipment chain

of custody monitoring,
meaning that we meticulously

track the location and the
status of all equipment

within our data center.

This means that we track
the location and status

of every hard drive, from
acquisition to destruction,

using bar codes and asset tags.

These asset tags are scanned
throughout a hard drive's

lifecycle in a data
center from the time

that it's installed
to the time that it's

removed from circulation.

And tracking these
hard drives closely

ensures that they don't
go missing or end up

in the wrong hands.

We also make sure hard
drives are properly

functioning by doing
frequent performance tests.

If a component fails to
pass a performance test,

then it's deemed
no longer usable.

So to prevent any
sensitive information

from living on that disk, then
we remove it from inventory

to be erased and destroyed
in layer 6, disk erase.

Disks enter layer 6 through a
secure two-way locker system,

allowing only
authorized personnel

to retrieve it in layer 6,
which you're seeing here.

When a hard drive is
erased and retired,

the disk erase formatter
uses a zero-filling method

that wipes the disk data and
replaces each bit of data

with zeros.

And we try to recycle
drives and their components.

But if a drive can't
be erased, then it's

stored securely until it
can be physically destroyed,

as you can see here.

And it'd be pretty
impossible to recover

any data from these drives.

And even if anyone tried to take
anything out of the data center

floor with them, we also
have metal detectors

and video surveillance to
ensure all personnel exiting

the data center
halls are properly

checked to prevent unauthorized
equipment from leaving

the floor.

If you're wondering what
happens to this waste,

we actually have researchers
in Google's Oklahoma facility

who are looking into methods
of collecting and recycling

rare earth metals
in hard drives.

Data centers are the largest
consumer of hard drives

that contain elements like
neodymium and dysprosium.

These are the same
elements that have

a role in the components
of electric cars.

And there's a great
article to check out

if you want to learn more.

Leaving layers 5 and 6 is
arguably more difficult

than entering, as
each person must

exit through full
metal detection

and detailed examination.

And fun fact-- Google Cloud
also employs a security testing

program where undercover
actors are, in our employ,

attempting to bring hardware
out of the data center.

This helps us constantly test
and improve our physical data

center security techniques.

We actually run dozens
of these drills a year,

paying unannounced,
skilled adversaries

to try to get past
controls by any means

necessary except for violence.

And this includes fake badges,
social engineering, fake UPS

trucks, ladder trucks to
get over the fence, people

hidden in trucks, attempts
in thick fog, everything.

And we usually win.

After every attempt, we actually
run a blameless post-mortem

to improve and make the
next attempt even harder.

And we ensure the strength
of our security controls

and iterate controls as needed.

This is all about building
a culture of security.

So these layers don't stop
at the physical layer.

They extend into our
technology stack that supports

Google Cloud products, too.

So at Google Cloud, we provide
capabilities and assistance

across Google, Cloud,
Workspace, and connected devices

that cover the whole
scope of responsibility.

We have a number of
native security features

that help protect you
from vulnerabilities,

like encryption in
transit and at rest.

And our hardware infrastructure
is custom-designed.

Our servers don't include
any unnecessary components,

like video cards or
peripheral interconnects,

that can introduce
any vulnerabilities.

And the same goes for software,
including low-level software

and our OS, which is a
stripped down, hardened

version of Linux.

Further, we also design and
include hardware specifically

for security, like Titan,
our custom security

chip that we use to establish
a hardware root of trust

in our servers and peripherals.

We build our network
hardware and software

to improve performance
as well as security.

So on Google Cloud, what's the
best way to approach security?

Well, cloud security is
a shared responsibility.

Depending on what cloud
service you're using,

Google Cloud will manage
various parts of security

above what we ensure through
our secure infrastructure.

So customers are responsible
for securing their own workloads

to meet their requirements
and compliance.

When it comes to cloud
security best practices,

there are two sides to it,
preventative and architectural

controls, which are implemented
through architecture and policy

decisions.

And first, we're going to cover
architectural controls, which

include the communication
between services,

how you structure your
resources on Google Cloud,

and permissions.

And then I'll quickly cover
detective controls, which

use monitoring capabilities
to look for drift, anomalous,

or malicious behavior
as it happens.

Let's talk about our
approach to security tooling

on Google Cloud.

We have layers of security
products and blueprints

for you to quickly
get started here.

So from the bottom up,
we have a global scale

technical infrastructure that's
designed to provide security

throughout the entire
information processing

lifecycle at Google.

And this infrastructure provides
secure deployment of services,

secure storage of data, secure
storage with end user privacy

safeguards, secure
communications

between services, and also
secure private communications

with customers over the internet
as well as safe operation

by administrators.

Building on top of the
secured core infrastructure,

the next layer is the
security products,

like Security Command
Center Premium, which

is our security and risk
management platform,

and assured workloads for
securing your government

workloads, which enable you
to secure your deployments.

These form the lowest levels
of the security stack.

And then on top of this baseline
are security foundations

blueprints.

These are security
blueprints which

include Google Cloud
security best practices that

are embedded within them.

So our goal here is
to make it much easier

for you to start and operate
securely on Google Cloud.

They actually enable you to
jump-start your deployments

by handling some of
your key advanced needs

without your teams first needing
to take time out and learn

all of the advanced skills.

They help you set up org
policies as a resource

hierarchy, networking, access,
logging, detective controls,

and then posture
blueprints, which

cover specific sets of
services and workloads.

Blueprints also
come in three tiers,

which differ in their level of
native support and lifecycle

management.

Supported blueprints are created
by the Google security teams

and managed as
products, which are

regular refreshes
and attestation

and testing of the
functionality and resilience.

They're all verified.

So blueprints can be created
by Google teams or partner

teams or even customer teams.

And the key is that the
lifecycle management

and attestation
of fit for purpose

is the responsibility
of the creating team.

And today, they're
offered via Terraform.

So compatible blueprints
can be created by anyone.

The requirement
is just that they

need to be correctly
formatted to operate

through the blueprint
tool chains.

And then we also
have blueprints that

address specific use cases,
like protecting storage buckets

or doing--

protecting BigQuery users, AI
notebooks, or Anthos, even.

So the topmost layer
here is comprised also

of your own web app and API
protection services, analytics,

or even high-performance
computing environments.

So the security
foundations blueprints

provides a strong starting
point for customers

to build and deploy
their organization.

So customers have access
to the opinionated guide

of the full Terraform
repo of automation scripts

to deploy the
foundational landing zone.

And it can be deployed
either at the full org level

or at the folder level
in the hierarchy.

These blueprints provide an
opinionated vetting pattern

for resource hierarchy,
org policies, IAM,

separation of duties, network
architecture, data access

segmentation, logging,
and detective controls

across projects and accounts.

So that way, you can meet
your security compliance

and have a starting point.

And then you can also start
to build your own workloads

and projects on top.

It provides the foundation
upon which you can further

deploy an increasing number
of opinionated Google-created

security posture blueprints
for specific products,

sets of services, and workloads.

And we update these blueprints
on a six-month cycle.

We also provide a project
factory Terraform module

that enables you to
set the parameters

and constraints for projects
when they are created.

You can access the latest
reference guide, PDF,

and the Terraform scripts repo
from the Google Cloud Security

Best Practices Resource Center.

And here, in addition to the
curated set of Google Cloud

security blueprints,
you can also

access both the
Google BeyondProd

paper, which lays out the
principles and practices

of Google's approach for
Cloud-native security

and how we think about and
how we operate Cloud-native.

For customers who want to
dive deeper into the knowledge

and experience that Google
has, then the Resource Center

also includes a link to
our building security

and reliable systems
reference book.

Additionally, a range
of detailed background

white papers around
our reference materials

is available to customers
from that Resource Center.

And it covers topics like
infrastructure design

and how encryption at
rest and in transit

are handled on Google Cloud.

On the preventative
side, we also

launched Security
Command Center.

This is the canonical
security and risk

database for Google Cloud.

So it includes a risk
dashboard and analytics system

for surfacing, understanding,
and remediating

Google Cloud security and data
risk across your organization.

So this means from
one dashboard,

you can uncover
common web application

and vulnerabilities, like
cross-site scripting or

outdated libraries in
your web applications

running on App Engine,
GKE, and Compute Engine.

And you can also
detect threats using

logs running in Google Cloud
or common container attacks,

including suspicious binary
or suspicious library

and reverse shell.

Security Health Analytics is a
vulnerabilities dashboard here.

And it helps you view
security misconfigurations

by severity, compliance
standards, or project.

And you can take
action from there.

So with this, you can take
inventory of your Google Cloud

assets and partner solutions.

You can also understand exactly
what changed in your asset

history in near real time and
respond to the most pressing

issues first.

You can also receive
notifications

about new findings or updates
to findings within minutes

and be able to take action.

And also, you can identify
security misconfigurations

in your Google Cloud
assets and resolve them

by following actionable
recommendations

that they actually have there.

Lastly, you can catch
web vulnerabilities

before they hit production and
reduce your exposure to risks

and identify compliance-- so see
violations in your Google Cloud

assets and resolve them
with these recommendations.

And of course, you want
to be able to export them.

So you can export
compliance reports

to ensure all your resources
are meeting your compliance

requirements.

We have support for
compliance standards,

like Payment Card
Industry, which

is PCI, the International
Organization

for Standardization, ISO.

There's National Institute of
Standards and Technology, NIST,

and the Center for
Internet Security, CIS,

1 and 1.1, and benchmarks.

This industry-leading
threat intelligence

detects threats
