KELLY STIRMAN: Hello, and
welcome to "Helping You

Realize the Full Potential of
PostgreSQL with Google Cloud."

my name is Kelly
Stirman, and I'm

a Director of Product Management
in the Databases group.

Later in this presentation,
we'll hear from Phil and Tim

from Wayfair on how they're
using Postgres on Google Cloud.

In this session,
we're going to discuss

why so many of our customers
are choosing Postgres to build

new operational
systems and what we're

doing to help address
some of their challenges.

The team from Wayfair will talk
about their work with Postgres

on Google Cloud.

So let's get started
and start by discussing

exactly what Postgres is and a
brief overview of its history.

Postgres is a modern open-source
relational database, originally

developed at UC Berkeley, and
its first release was in 1996.

While commonly used to
manage relational data,

it supports a more comprehensive
set of data models,

like JSON, Key Value,
XML, geospatial,

and many more capabilities
through its powerful extension

model.

This rich data
model support means

that Postgres is used in a wide
range of database use cases.

Databases created
with Postgres are

used in every conceivable
type of application,

from the very simplest
single-user database

app to demanding enterprise
applications supporting

tens of thousands of
users running thousands

of transactions a second.

It's found on the simplest
single-board computers

to the largest Linux
servers with hundreds

of cores and
terabytes of memory,

managing petabytes of data.

So why have so many
of our customers

adopted Postgres as
a database of choice?

Well, organizations have
started looking for alternatives

to the commercial database
they have historically used.

They've done this as a means
of reducing the perceived

punitive cost and
the aggressive sales

practices that have somewhat
soured their experiences.

But given the number of
open-source databases

that are available, why
should you consider Postgres?

Well, Postgres has a
number of attributes that

make that decision simpler.

It provides a similar
and, in some cases,

better set of functionality
than the expensive closed-source

alternatives.

If you're looking for a database
that supports parallel query,

partition tables, stored
logic, replication, change data

capture, rich data models, and
so on, all in a single product,

then look no further
than Postgres.

On top of this
impressive functionality,

Postgres has demonstrated
itself in demanding customer

environments time
and time again,

giving others the
confidence to use it

in their own applications.

All this, and a friendly
and engaging community

with a rich set of
tools and utilities,

has made Postgres an easy choice
for many of our customers.

But perhaps the most
important aspect of Postgres

is its role as an open API.

While SQL is commonly
considered the language of data,

and is indeed responsible
for the ongoing success

of relational databases,
each relational database

has its own implementation
with functions and operators

that behave slightly
differently,

and more substantial differences
in programmatic APIs.

What Postgres has the
potential to deliver

is a common SQL layer
that is consistent,

regardless of the database
engine that underpins it.

Postgres-- certainly,
its SQL layer--

could lead to a standardization
of databases in the same way

we've seen Linux change the
enterprise operating system

world.



Cloud SQL for Postgres is part
of Google Cloud's fully managed

database portfolio.

It provides fully managed,
reliable database instances

with features that
make databases

easy to set up,
back up, restore,

and provide high availability.

It's the same
version of Postgres

that you can download from
the community website,

with the ability to
choose between the version

of the database that
suits your requirements.

Google takes care of the
heavy lifting on your behalf,

patching and securing
your databases

with very little downtime.

Cloud SQL aims to provide
the best Postgres experience

anywhere in the cloud.

So given the many
options you have

when deciding on where to
run your Postgres databases,

why should you
choose Google Cloud?

Well, Google understands
the importance of the role

that open source plays
in the enterprise

and is committed to provide
the best experience for users

of Postgres.

We particularly
understand the importance

that Postgres will
play as a SQL standard

for databases in the future.

We offer a one-of-a-kind
platform to run your Postgres

databases, using the same
infrastructure that runs many

of the Google applications
you use daily.

You get access to fast
and scalable compute

and high-performance,
low-latency networks

with a global reach.

Google continues to invest
in its own dedicated

global network backbone
and standing up

data centers around
the world to ensure

you have the fastest and most
secure access to your data.

We will continue to offer the
best experience for developers,

whether you're building out
your own VM-based applications

or building them on
top of Kubernetes.

Google Cloud offers modern
APIs and frameworks,

whether you plan to
use Postgres to build

modern microservices
or more traditional

monolithic applications.

We understand developers
and are committed

to making your teams as
productive as possible.

We've created integrations
and management tools

to simplify how you make
the most of your data.

And we provide
rich and open APIs

to protect your
application investments.



We've been hard at work
adding important features

to Cloud SQL for Postgres.

Recently, we added support for
logical replication and IAM

authentication, making
Cloud SQL easier

to integrate with your
core enterprise systems.

Cloud SQL for Postgres now
supports over 140 flags

and 44 extensions.

We have tuned the operating
systems on our Cloud SQL

instances for
database workloads.

Google Cloud was
the first to support

Postgres 13 in the cloud.

And in just a moment, we'll
talk about Cloud SQL insights

and cost recommendations
via Active Assist.



Our database migration service
makes migration simple, safe,

and secure.

DMS is serverless, so there's
nothing for you to provision

or manage.

DMS will do all that
heavy lifting for you.

More than 85% of DMS
migrations are underway

in less than an hour.

And a majority of
these migrations

are coming from other clouds.

Observability is critical
for managing your database

deployments.

Recently, we launched
SQL Insights,

giving you best-in-class
database observability using

open standards.

SQL Insights helps
your developer teams

to understand
performance issues,

whether you're building
a monolithic app

or using microservices.

And now we provide
cost recommendations

through Active Assist, helping
you right-size your resources

and optimize your spend,
potentially saving you

thousands of dollars a month.

So thus far, we've been talking
about Cloud SQL for Postgres.

Now I'd like to spend
a few minutes talking

about Cloud Spanner and some
work we're doing with Postgres.

Cloud Spanner is the
relational database

that banks, game studios,
retailers and organizations,

and many other industries
trust with their most

demanding workloads.

It's the same database
that powers Google's

most recognizable products.

Spanner offers global
consistency and five nines

of availability at
almost any scale,

without painful sharding or
re-architecture as you grow.

Spanner's new
lower cost of entry

now makes realizing these
benefits even easier.

You can start small and
be assured that Spanner

will scale to meet your needs.

Even with Spanner and all of
Google Cloud's unique benefits,

our customers want options.

Spanner isn't the only managed
database service out there.

We want our customers
to feel confident

that they'll be able
to move their data

and applications elsewhere
without a disruptive rewrite.

The PostgreSQL interface
for Cloud Spanner

that we announced earlier today
will provide the scalability

and reliability of Spanner
that enterprises trust, along

with the familiarity and
portability of Postgres

that developers love.

We're making it so you can bring
your existing skills and tools

around Postgres
to take advantage

of the unique
capabilities Spanner

has to offer in terms of
availability and scalability.

So, to sum it up,
Postgres is becoming

the relational
database of choice

for the enterprise
for many good reasons.

We believe Google Cloud
offers the best place

to run your Postgres databases.

And we're seeing a trend to
make Postgres's SQL layer

act as an open API for
applications and deployments.

Now, I'd like to hand
things over to our friends

from Wayfair.

Tim and Phil,
please take it away.

TIM QUINNEY: Thanks, Kelly.

Hello.

My name is Tim
Quinney, and I lead

the product team for database
platforms here at Wayfair.

I'm joined by Phil
Portnoy, who's

our lead architect and
engineer for database platform

development.

Wayfair is a platform
that's solely

focused on the category of
home across our six brands,

including our marquee
Wayfair.com, and our specialty

brands of Perigold, AllModern,
Joss & Main, Birch Lane,

as well as our Wayfair
professional business.

We have more than 31
million active customers,

shopping a catalog of
more than 20 million items

from a network of more than
16,000 global suppliers.

Powering the systems to
make this all possible

is a team of over 3,000 software
engineers and data scientists.

When considering the needs
of our engineering community,

the use cases we
support run the gamut

from integrating the
suppliers to build our catalog

to marketing the
products and powering

the customer-facing
shopping experience online,

all the way to managing
the delivery of orders

through our global logistics
and operational systems.

To accomplish this,
our database strategy

is focused on providing
well-paved paths for our users

to quickly provision and
deploy database solutions that

meet their scale, resiliency,
and latency requirements,

all while providing a high-tier
support and subject matter

expertise.

Core to this strategy is
Postgres and Google's suite

of database products.

Whether it be single-region
reads and writes

for similar applications
running on Cloud

SQL or a globally distributed
system running on Google Cloud

Spanner, we have found
that Google's suite

of database offerings enable
us to drive innovation.

To share more about why
we're excited about Postgres

and the Google offering,
I'll hand it over

to my colleague, Phil.

PHIL PORTNOY: Thanks, Tim.

For me, as an
enterprise architect

for a fairly large
engineering organization

of a couple of thousands
of engineers and analysts,

technology matters.

PostgreSQL, being an open-source
and free-to-use product,

is the type of technology
that enables large enterprises

like Wayfair to have control
over their own destiny

in the data space.

PostgreSQL is a
proven technology.

Our developers can use it with
any architecture and software

stack of their choice,
without compromising

velocity and portability.

There is a massive
amount of learning

materials, documentation,
open-source guides.

And community support is
available around the clock,

which truly puts
developers first.

However, as most of
you probably know,

considerations about databases
don't end with developers.

Managing provisioning,
orchestration, monitoring,

and maintenance of physical
or virtual infrastructure

is a massive component
of operating data stores.

Google Cloud Platform takes
the infrastructure management

challenge out of the
equation completely,

allowing us to focus effort
and resources entirely

on product development.

Using open-source
solutions helps

Wayfair to transform
our business

in much more ways than one.

But there is one benefit
that's hard to overlook,

and that benefit is cost.

In modern, fast-paced
technological environments,

time to market is critical.

And PostgreSQL on
Google's Cloud SQL

allows us to minimize the
effort of preparing our products

and applications
to serve production

workloads, while significantly
reducing the overall cost

of the solution.

We've discovered that supporting
similar workloads on Cloud SQL

and PostgreSQL is anywhere
from four to eight times

cheaper than a comparable
commercial database

engine provisioned
on Compute Engine,

after accounting
for licensing costs

and depending on the
redundancy and distribution

level of the
deployment, of course.

On top of that
difference, with Cloud SQL

being a completely
managed service,

there are additional
cost savings

associated with
dramatic reduction

in operating costs compared
to deploying on premises

or in an unmanaged fashion.

This makes PostgreSQL a
perfect, cost-effective solution

for the majority of online
relational data storage

needs in Wayfair.

However, for some
distributed use cases

where consistent, safe
writes to the same data set

are happening from
multiple locations,

spanning countries and
sometimes continents,

a slightly different
solution is required.

That's where Google
Cloud Spanner comes in,

a truly distributed
and truly consistent

solution for relational
database workloads that

require distribution.

We're able to provision
distributed data stores

within minutes and with
almost zero operational effort

required from us.

Thanks to Google's
TrueTime distributed clock,

Spanner is capable of providing
the same consistency guarantees

as PostgreSQL at a minimal
added latency cost,

switching from writing and
storing data in a single data

center to persisting
the same data

points in a globally
distributed database.

And having the data
available locally

for clients around
the world requires

next to zero development time.

And with technologies
like PostgreSQL Interface

for Spanner, software
product journeys

can start with a local
PostgreSQL database

and shift towards Spanner
later in the lifecycle,

providing global availability
in an effortless fashion.

Back to Tim.

TIM QUINNEY: Echoing what
both Phil and Kelly shared,

the value proposition
of Postgres

is highly resonant to us.

It's open source
and cost efficient.

It has tremendous
community support,

with low barriers of
adoption for our users.

Google's investment in database
products leveraging Postgres,

from Cloud SQL to the new
Postgres interface in Spanner,

becomes increasingly
compelling for us,

because these products are
offered as managed services

and enable portability
to follow the lifecycle

of an application.

I'm really excited about
this concept of portability.

An application can start with
a simple Cloud SQL instance.

Maybe it's a proof of concept
on a Friday afternoon.

And before the team knows it,
it's a runtime-critical system.

In due configuration, you
can enable scale read.

If it grows to the occasion
needing global distribution,

it can be migrated
over to Spanner

without the need of a
significant re-architecture.

This saves us from over
provisioning infrastructure

from perpetual rewrites
of applications

and from the significant
overhead of managing

a sharded database environment.

For these reasons, teams
such as our supply chain,

catalog engineering,
marketing technology,

are already leveraging
Postgres on Cloud SQL

for some of their systems.

Additionally, Spanner is
quickly gaining traction,

their home services
and customs platform

teams recently adopting.

As we look to the future,
we're excited to see

what kind of performance
and operational gains

can be achieved as we consider
moving other systems to Cloud

SQL and Cloud Spanner.

One that comes to mind
that's particularly exciting

for us is our user profile
service, which is currently

on a sharded
database environment

across many servers.

This is a prime candidate
for migration to Spanner

and core to our customer
shopping experience.

And now I'll hand
it back to Kelly.

KELLY STIRMAN: Thanks,
Phil and Tim, for that.

And thanks to all of you
for joining us today.

We appreciate it.

Hope you have a great day.
