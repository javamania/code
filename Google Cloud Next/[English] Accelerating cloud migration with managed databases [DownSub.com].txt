ANITA KIBUNGUCHY-GRANT:
Hello, and welcome

to Google Cloud Next.

In this session,
we'll walk through how

to accelerate your move to the
cloud with managed databases.

If you're here to learn
about Cloud SQL, Bare Metal

Solution for Oracle, Database
Migration Service, and more,

then you are in the right place.

We'll also explore why Google
Cloud for your databases.

My name is Anita
Kbunguchy-Grant,

and I am the product
marketing lead here

for the Databases organization.

And I have the pleasure of being
joined by GG, group product

manager for databases.

So let's go ahead
and get started.



Here's a quick agenda
for this session.

We'll start with
what we're seeing

in the industry across trends,
go through five reasons

why Google Cloud
for your databases.

We'll hear from GG about
real-world customer use cases

and finally end with
how to get started,

including some important
resources you should check out.



So some migration trends.

Managed services just
makes sense for databases.

I have never met someone
who loved managing database

infrastructure, at
least just not yet.

When you think about
all the care and feeding

necessary to keep your
databases healthy,

there are a lot of
things to consider--

all the work to provision,
set up, and maintain

your hardware, the operating
system, and database software,

plus all the management
tools and [INAUDIBLE] patches

for security and maintenance;
scaling the system;

ensuring that your backups and
restores are meeting recovery

goals; and that the
application can continue

to run during various failure
recoveries and scenarios;

on top of all this,
monitoring all of these things

to make sure that
your system is running

the way your business needs to.

This is a lot of work
and pretty diverse set

of skills that are needed.

Consider the
thousands of databases

run by many companies.

This work really adds up.

Most importantly,
these are things

that are just table
stakes for you

and typically not
the things that

help you outmaneuver
your competitors.

It's therefore no
surprise that databases

are moving fast to the cloud.

According to Gartner,
75% of all databases

will be deployed or migrated
to a Cloud platform by 2022,

and this is massive.

It's important to note that the
Cloud DBMS market is not new,

but what is new is a growth
in cloud revenue, which

is actually projected to account
for 50% of the total DBMS

market revenue by 2023.

This trend actually helps
reinforce the notion

that cloud service provider
infrastructure and the services

that run on top of
them are becoming

the new data-management
platforms.

And because of
this, it's no wonder

that so many companies
are turning to managed

services in the cloud--

for their databases, that is.

So why not let someone
else who does it

for millions of
deployments and who's

been automating systems
like this for decades

handle this for you?

Let's talk about why Google
Cloud offers the best place

to migrate your databases.



We'll start with
reason number one.

We offer a
comprehensive platform

that allows you
to securely unify

the data across your
entire organization.

This allows you to break
down silos, increase agility,

innovate faster, and support
business transformation.

We connect the different
roles that work with data

and provide them a common
platform to build upon.

So no matter where
you start, there's

always more places to go across
analytics, databases, AI,

and machine-learning services.

BigQuery, our fully managed
enterprise data warehouse,

allows you to run analytics
at scale up to 34% lower TCO

than other cloud data
warehouse alternatives.

Spanner provides
unlimited scale,

global consistency across
regions, and high availability

up to five nines.

Looker provides a
single shared place

for people and
applications to interact

with it no matter the cloud.

And these are just a
few of the key services

you can take advantage of on
the Google Cloud data platform.

As I mentioned earlier,
no matter where you start,

there's always more places to
go with best-in-class products

across the entire
data lifecycle.



Let's take a look at
reason number two.

At Google Cloud, we
understand that most companies

have a multidatabase strategy.

In some cases, it's intentional.

In others, it's a natural
outcome of growth and change

over the years,
plus the fact that

replatforming a database
can be very intimidating.

So we've been steadily focused
on building options that

help meet you
where you are today

and also give you a
path for the future.

When you look at some of
the most popular databases,

there are great options
on Google Cloud.

These are for Oracle, SQL
Server, Postgres, and MySQL.

And for Postgres,
MySQL, and SQL Server,

the Database Migration
Service provides

a serverless experience for
quickly and safely migrating

your databases from
anywhere to Cloud SQL.

We also support nonrelational
database workloads.

If you're using
Redis, you can now

take advantage of Google Cloud
Memorystore for Redis or Redis

Labs, one of our key
database partners.

For Memcached, you can now
use Memorystore for Memcached.

For HBase and if you're ready
to move off your Hadoop stack,

you can easily
migrate to Bigtable,

which has been in production
for over 15 years at Google

and is the original
inspiration for HBase.

For all that MongoDB
you're self-managing,

you can use MongoDB
Atlas on Google Cloud.

All of these provide
options and flexibility

to quickly and safely migrate
to the cloud, helping meet you

where you are.



Let's take a look at
reason number three.

We've talked about some of
the product capabilities.

Let's do a deeper dive
into some of them.

Let's start with Cloud SQL.

Cloud SQL is our fully managed
relational database service

and one of Google Cloud's
fastest-growing top services.

Over the past year,
the team has been

focused on addressing
many of the major blockers

for customers, and we now
have unique capabilities

in the market.

We added the Database
Migration Service

to migrate your MySQL,
Postgres, and SQL Server

workloads to Cloud SQL.

We've significantly
reduced maintenance windows

by over 80%, and we've also
launched Cloud SQL Insights,

which bring database
observability

to your developers.

We were first to market to
support the latest versions,

including Postgres
13, because we

want to make sure this
is the simplest migration

experience for you.

Cloud SQL also
offers integration

with Kubernetes, which makes
connecting your applications

easy and secure.

It also supports
federation with BigQuery,

and we've seen users carrying
over 125 petabytes of data

in Cloud SQL, on
average, in one month.

And so Cloud SQL is pretty
ready for you critical

relational workloads on MySQL,
Postgres, and SQL Server.

The next service we'll
do a deeper dive on

is the Bare Metal
Solution for Oracle.

We've taken an optimized
approach with our BMS solution

for Oracle.

We provide certified
and optimized hardware

for your Oracle
workloads, allowing

you to run all versions of
Oracle database, including RAC,

and all the tools and
playbooks you use today,

such as Data Guard and RMAN.

You get to maintain your
on-premises licensing, run

books, DBAs, and
system integrators.

Google provides management
of the data center

with enterprise-grade
security and reliability.

We're available in
13 cloud regions,

and we're less than
2 milliseconds away

from Google Cloud resources.

With Bare Metal
Solution for Oracle,

you have full control
over how the data is

managed using optimized
and certified SAN storage.



And finally, we'll take a
look at some of the tools

and partners available.

As I mentioned earlier, we
announced Database Migration

Service to migrate your MySQL,
Postgres, and SQL Server

workloads onto Cloud SQL, and
we're seeing a lot of customers

start to use Database
Migration Service to migrate

their workloads.

We also hear that DMS is easy
to use, and more than 85%

of the migrations using DMS are
underway in less than one hour.

We also announced Datastream
earlier this year,

a CDC and change data capture
service that provides access

to streaming low-latency data
from Oracle and MySQL databases

with integrations across
BigQuery, Cloud Spanner,

Dataflow and Data Fusion.

We also work with partner
solutions like Stream

and also offer assessment
tools, including StratoZone

and migVisor to get you quickly
started on your migration

journey.



Reason number four for
why Google Cloud is we

provide robust
tools and technology

to protect and govern your
data throughout its lifecycle.

We realize that security
and governance are

key concerns for many
of our customers,

and providing these
controls are key to peace

of mind for your databases.

We offer built-in data
protection at scale,

and this is by
default. All your data

is automatically encrypted
while in transit and at rest.

We've also added
customer-managed encryption

keys for some of
our key services,

including Cloud SQL and Spanner.

Secondly, we supply
tools and technology

to efficiently govern your data.

Cloud Identity and
Access Management

provides access
control and visibility

into security policies
across your organization.

Thirdly, we support
compliance requirements

with third-party audits
and certifications.

And finally, we
believe that trust

is created through
transparency, and so we provide

tools such as Access
Transparency which give you

visibility into accesses by
either support or engineering.

And all these
capabilities ensure

that your data is protected.



And finally, let's look
at reason number five

for why Google Cloud.

It goes without saying
that your databases are

as good as your availability.

We offer five nines
industry-leading

SLA across our cloud-native
databases, Spanner, Firestore,

and Bigtable, and four
nines SLA for BigQuery.

And these databases
are actually built

on Google's dedicated
network, and they're

battle tested by Google
Cloud Services used

by billions of users,
and they're actually

made available for your use.

All these services are simply
unmatched for speed, scale,

security, and capability
for any sized organization,

and these availability
SLAs ensure

that your business continues
to run without disruption.

So there you have
it, five key reasons

why migrating your
databases to Google Cloud

is a good move
for your business,

from the fact that
we offer managed

services for your Oracle,
MySQL, Postgres, and SQL Server

workloads, including
Redis, MongoDB, and HBase,

to the sophisticated security
and privacy controls,

all the way to the five nines
availability across some

of our key services.



Whew.

I realize that was a
ton of information,

so it would be good
to be able to bring

all these things to life.

So let's do a deep dive
into three key customer use

cases across some of
these key services.

So I'm excited to welcome
GG, group product manager

to talk more to us.

Welcome, GG.

GURMEET GOINDI:
Thank you, Anita.

Indeed, that is a great
overview of our portfolio

and the reasons why customers
are choosing our solutions.

And I 100% agree with you.

In my 20 years of my career
here in Silicon Valley,

I have not met a single person
who wakes up in the morning

and said managing databases
really excites me.

What they do wake
up and tell us is

how we can help them run these
databases more efficiently,

more reliably, help them build
new customer experiences,

at the same time
lowering their cost.

One such customer that
I like to talk about

is a leading travel service
provider or travel company,

you might say.

This industry is
in a lot of churn,

and customers are trying
to-- these companies

are trying to build
new experiences

for their customers, and the
customer base is also evolving.

So this company turned
to us, and the reason

they like the strategy is
the breadth of our product

portfolio, whether it be the
world's leading five nines

databases such as
Spanner or our ability

to provide a stable,
secure, high-performing home

for their legacy databases at
states which might be running

on databases like Oracle.

This particular
customer had a lot

of Oracle databases running on
premises, on AWS, you name it.

The permanent solution, we
were able to provide them

a home where they can
migrate as is and then

upgrade these
databases to Spanner

or other cloud-native
databases at their own pace.

Not only they were able to
keep all of their run books

and playbooks and partners
as is, at the same time

they were able to benefit
from the extreme low latency

to Google Cloud so that they
can iterate their workloads back

and forth between a
cloud-native database

and a traditional
database such as Oracle.

What was a little
needle mover for them,

they had [INAUDIBLE]
of Oracle versions,

and they probably used every
possible Oracle HA technology.

With Oracle BMS, they've
been able to leverage

those technologies
as is and move

the databases to production
in a record amount of time.

On the other
spectrum of industry,

I would like to share an
example with a leading

German bank we are working on.

All of you might know banks are
really particular about data

security-- not that
others are not,

but they're regulated towards
data security, data residency,

and privacy.

With the Oracle
Bare Metal Solution,

they were able to meet
their stringent regulatory

requirements placed
upon them as a business.

At the same time, with the
help of our engineering teams,

they were able to migrate over a
hundred mission-critical Oracle

databases to Oracle Bare Metal
Solution within three months.

Now they're using
the data sitting

in the databases in
Bare Metal Solution

to bring new
experiences by using

cloud-native databases in GCP.

Last but not the least, I
would like to talk about one

of my favorite use cases is
this big ticketing marketplace

which built the entire business
on a set of clustered databases

running on Oracle.

And they looked to GCP to help
them take this marketplace

and transform it in
an extensible scale

that Spanner provides--
extensible and five-nine

availability that
Spanner provides.

But this journey is
not simple and needs

a lot of steps and
iteration between them.

So they decided to move their
clustered databases, which

is running on aging hardware,
to the state of the art

infrastructure provided by
Oracle Bare Metal Solution that

enabled them to not only
modernize or at least lower

the cost of running
the databases using

modern hardware on
Oracle Bare Metal

Solution-- at the
same time, start

modernizing their existing
applications with Google Cloud

Spanner.



Last but not least,
this customer

has been live with running one
of the largest Oracle clusters

in any public cloud of
Bare Metal Solution,

and we are very happy
to have them here.

With that being said, Anita,
I'll hand it back to you

to take us to this presentation.

Thank you for your time.



ANITA KIBUNGUCHY-GRANT:
Thank you so much, GG.

Those are all such
great example use cases,

and I'm sure many of that will
actually resonate with you.

So how should you think
about moving forward

with your migration journey?



A good migration plan is
going to have four key phases.

First, your
assessment phase where

you work to understand
exactly what you have already.

Secondly, based on
that assessment,

you start to plan
what you should move

and how you should move it.

Third, you start to execute
the migration itself.

And finally, you fine tune and
optimize what you've migrated.

I think this should
sound pretty familiar.

GG just talked about the
customer who actually

went through these type
of four key phases,

and they're actually still
going through that journey.

And I realized that we're
representing this migration

plan as a single circle,
but in reality, it's

a bit more recursive
in that you'll

have your high-level
migration plan,

but then you also have
groups of applications called

migration waves that have their
own specific plans as well,

and each subsequent
plan in theory

is adapting the lessons from
previous migration waves.

In addition, it's not
uncommon to go back and forth

between each of the
four different phases.

It's all about building
that migration muscle memory

and realizing that
this is a journey.



And so what tools do we offer?

And all of these should now
sound very, very familiar.

For your database
assessments, you

should check up
migVisor and StratoZone.

We have 50-plus
regional champions

trained on migVisor that are
a combination of CEs, PSO,

and partner
engineering teams who

are ready to help you
carry out your assessments.

We also offer partner
programs as well.

We also talked about the
Database Migration Service

for your MySQL, Postgres,
and SQL Server workloads.

And finally, we're also
working really hard

to improve that customer
experience across our teams

and services to help you quickly
and safely and efficiently

migrate your databases
to Google Cloud.



And last but not least,
make sure you check out

this great white-paper resource
with a lot of good information

around migrating your databases.

It has a lot of the
content we spoke about

in this presentation
and actually provides it

in much more detail.

It will be included
in the Resource

section of this presentation.

You can also get started with
some hands-on labs as well.

I know that Cloud SQL
is widely represented,

and so you can actually
get started on checking out

the hands-on labs there.

And so I'd like
to thank you again

for joining us for
this presentation

and for this session, and we
absolutely value your feedback,

so please take the
time to provide it.

Let us know what we did
well and what we could have

done to improve for next time.



Thank you so much,
and thanks again,

GG, for joining me this session.

GURMEET GOINDI: Thanks,
Anita, for having me.
