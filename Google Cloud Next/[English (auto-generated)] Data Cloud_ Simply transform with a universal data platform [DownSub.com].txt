[Music]

hello and welcome to our very first

spotlight i hope you enjoyed the opening

keynote for the next hour we will be

diving into all things data i'm

stephanie wong a developer advocate and

i'm here with garrett kasmeier who leads

database analytics and bi solutions at

google cloud

thanks stephanie i'm very excited to be

here and to share with everyone what we

have been working on

the team thought we start on the light

side of things here and start with a

joke one of my favorite jokes actually

so

here it goes a secret query walks into a

bar

and approaches two tables and asks

can i join you

[Music]

okay i guess we wrote a video instead

innovation is a huge challenge in

baseball the current mlb fan expects us

to be relevant customers call us

patients call us members call us and you

can imagine a team that's just buried

under the weight of thousands of call

recordings

we look at so much data everything you

can imagine we analyze frankly we spend

70 percent of our time just trying to to

capture it and trying to sift through it

we're expecting to

transfer around 300 to 400 petabytes to

the cloud

it's hard to even describe how big that

is

google cloud was very impressive to us

it allowed us flexibility in storage and

compute scaling google cloud provides us

with technology that will drive us to be

better

now our team can look at hundreds of

calls a day in minutes instead of weeks

with google cloud we're going to be able

to spend our time analyzing real time

and using the data that we've been

collecting

we thought google cloud was the best

partner for us i think this is very much

going to be an open and evolving

long-term relationship between google

and twitter it's a perfect fit with

google cloud as we go forward google's

made it possible for us to reach

exceptional customer experience in a way

that hasn't been done before

[Music]

and welcome back so what are we solving

for today this spotlight session is

about how to leverage data as your most

strategic business asset especially as

you adapt to and anticipate change

data has the power to transform stagnant

businesses into profitable ones

streamline operations to improve

people's lives and identify areas of

waste to radically reduce unnecessary

spending

it can be used to solve businesses and

world problems both the simple ones and

the ones that keep people up at night

it has the potential to accelerate

progress faster than a think tank or

world summit

and it's largely untapped

as you learn more about google cloud

capabilities and make progress on your

data cloud journey you can unlock your

own 10x mindset as external factors

accelerate the pace of change

never before have we faced this much

uncertainty and now is the time when

every company can turn data into an

ability

the reality today is that too many

companies struggle to remove the

barriers to turn data into intelligence

this is exactly what we are seeing with

our customers turning data into

intelligence and delivering value is no

longer a nice to have it is essential a

recent study shows that only 32 percent

of the companies surveyed gain value

from their data investments and this is

the result of difficult to access slow

unreliable complex and fragmented

systems

many companies just feel overwhelmed

with the demand for the various types of

working with data and of doing it at

scale they feel walled in with a lack of

integration a lack of openness a lack of

portability and very poor apis

it is time to reimagine our data cloud

strategy that is unlocking your data

advantage

build great applications that understand

and interact with your customer on

operational databases that scale to

billions of queries per second

react on any event in real time and

process millions of data streams

analyze petabytes of data without sizing

or tuning your data warehouse anymore

and ultimately optimize your processes

with hundreds of machine learning models

in production

this is how you unlock your data cloud

and unlock your data advantage

to build your data cloud you need your

systems to be simple

and this requires a partner that meets

you where you are today and helps you to

mature where you want to be

but at your own pace

making the complex simple is our

business

it has been for decades building systems

that mask the complexity of the entire

internet behind a simple single

interface and building applications with

billions of users

it all runs on data and analytics so you

can say the data is our dna

and we can't predict the future but we

can plan for it and we are deeply

grateful to work with tens of thousands

of organizations who build their data

clouds on google cloud

and unlock ultimately their data

advantage from databases to analytics to

streams to lakes to ai

and build a unified data cloud together

with us

it's leaders like you who are

accelerating their use of data to

transform complexity into simplicity

this week at next you'll hear from

leading organizations that have chosen

google cloud for their data cloud

strategy over market alternatives

verizon media is one of these customers

verizon uses bigquery and looker to

scale their massive enterprise media

warehouse supporting monthly scans of

more than one exabyte of data

the performance improvements include

90 percent plus productivity

improvements across the board and lower

overall tco compared to other cloud

providers

almost overnight traffic to chess.com

tripled the pandemic and successful

series the queen's gambit created a

perfect storm

ten years worth of growth occurred in

just six months and daily active users

rose from 280 000 to more than 1 million

there's no way to handle that search

without the move to google cloud using

bigquery's near infinite ability to

scale in response to demand this meant

that chess.com didn't have to forecast

site traffic and worry about unexpected

surges or waste money by over

provisioning servers that go unused take

autotrader it's uk's largest online

automotive marketplace and they were

able to migrate more than 60 of their

current oracle footprint to cloud sql

autotrader builds their data cloud by

leveraging cloud sql bigquery and looker

to deliver access to their data to all

of their users and with cloud sql as a

fully managed service auto greater

release cadence has improved by over 130

percent year over year enabling an

impressive peak of more than

450 releases to production

on a single day and this is how you

build your data advantage

when cardinal health migrated to google

cloud they enabled disaster recovery

increased their ability to respond to

business challenges and leverage machine

learning to drive business efficiencies

all while reducing their cost by 25

we would like to welcome ray bajaj cto

of cardinal health to share their data

transformation story

ray thank you so much for joining us

here today

thanks stephanie and i'm really happy to

be here today cardinal health is a

pioneer in healthcare industry for

leveraging the cloud as a primary source

of infrastructure

achieving our cloud transformation

journey goal

with more than 80 percent of our

workload fully migrated onto the cloud

our journey to google cloud started in

2018 leveraging the security and

flexibility of google cloud

allows us to scale and innovate at lower

cost

which empowers our organization to focus

on building the future of healthcare

and driving better outcomes across the

healthcare ecosystem so

why google cloud

with google we can deliver modern data

insights capabilities

to our engineering teams so that they

can transform our core business

while also improving the customer

experience

helping the organization evolve

in the adjacent areas of healthcare

we also selected google cloud because of

its ability to partner with sap

and run massive erp workloads reliably

now what outcomes have you been able to

realize as a result of this

we leveraged google's local and bigquery

to develop episode analytics a data

driven predictive cost tracking tool

that enables community oncology

practices to accurately measure

the cost of care and provides clearer

insights

into value-based performance

well ray cardinal is clearly at the

forefront of these shifts and we can't

wait to see what's in store for you so

thank you so much for being here with us

today

thank you

organizations like cardinal health are

solving complex challenges with google

cloud

but

what is holding others back from using

data to accelerate innovation

companies are looking for solutions that

can simplify their data landscape to

move from a state where every scenario

requires a new tool to an agile platform

that combines data analytics databases

data engineering and science security

and governance into a single platform to

move from data at rest to a platform

where data is accessible in real time

our vision is to provide a platform that

allows data to unfold its full potential

ultimately enabling us to reach new

horizons ranging from newly built

digital experiences products and

business models to advanced machine

learning and ai to ultimately empowering

humans to reason beyond their own

biological capacity

and we have built the industry's most

simple intelligent and best integrated

cloud data platform that enables

businesses to fuel their own digital

transformation

and this is how you unlock your data

advantage

to seize new opportunities improve

operational efficiencies and deliver new

user experiences that delight customers

partners and your employees

thanks to you our customers and partners

google's data platform is one of the

fastest growing clouds fueled by the

demand for products like big query and

here comes the most exciting part today

we are excited to announce a number of

new product innovations

and the first announcement goes out to

all of the data engineers in the world

who are using spark on google cloud open

standards are at the heart of our data

cloud strategy and at google we follow

an open approach that enables

flexibility and choice and today i am

excited to announce project big spark it

is the world's first auto scaling

serverless spark service in existence

and regardless of whether you are a big

query user a data proc user our cloud ai

user we have created an integrated

ecosystem around spark the de facto

standard for data engineering workloads

we want to make it easy for you to

onboard on our platform with spark and

never limit your ambition with data

science and data engineering

our long history in the open source

community has shown us that betting on

the community first is always the right

strategy to give our customers

portability and optionality we're

excited to make spark a first-class

citizen on our platform and to automate

the productionalization of your data

engineering and data science workloads

the next announcement goes to all of the

data scientists

as enterprises consolidate their data

platforms the distinction between

advanced analytics and data science and

machine learning is really diminishing

today more than ever data scientists are

looking for a unified interface to be

able to seamlessly connect their entire

data estate and also run all

explorations with sql spark and other

machine learning libraries with vertex

ai we have simplified the experience for

data scientists with 80 percent less

code required to drain a model compared

to any other platform

as a part of google's vertex ai strategy

i am happy to announce the brief view of

ai notebook for vertex ci that offers a

fully managed scalable and enterprise

great ide combined with easily

enforceable policies and user management

these ai notebook innovations are great

examples of google bringing together the

power of data and ai

google truly aims to fast-track

innovation by eliminating the need for

data scientists to shift context between

aspects like data analytics data science

and machine learning

that is right on and here is an exciting

announcement to all of the developers

we are adding a postgres interface

for spanner which continues our

commitment to openness and reinforces

our efforts to democratize the access to

spanner with this new postgres interface

enterprises can take advantage of

spanner's unmatched global scale

five nines of availability and strong

consistency using skills and tools from

the popular postgres ecosystem and

starting today you can create a spanner

database that uses postgres sql dialect

and connect with its open wire protocol

this interface supports banner's rich

feature set using the most popular

postgres data types and sql features and

thus democratizing access to spanner for

millions of developers out there our

commitment to the ecosystem has been

long standing with ongoing support for

cloud sql for mysql postgres and sql

server so you can lift and shift your

databases

our mission with cloud sql is

compatibility and we were the first

cloud provider to support postgres 13.

these announcements are so exciting

because postgres has emerged as a

popular choice for operational databases

postgres is known and love for its

stability and feature set and has built

an active and growing ecosystem of

developers and tools

our investments in postgres are a step

in the right direction to continue

meeting developers where they are with

the tools they love we are excited to

announce new ways to help organizations

going beyond traditional business

intelligence to analyze access and act

on data looker continues to integrate

with the other offerings in our

portfolio as well as continues to

innovate with our core product and to

address the needs we are continuing to

simplify the experience across bigquery

looker and data studio together with

connected sheets today we are announcing

new enhancements which bring the reality

of augmented analytics to more people

with looker's solution for contact

center ai to help businesses leverage ai

and converse naturally with customers

and deliver outstanding experiences

we are also announcing a new looker

block for healthcare nlp ai which

creates a user interface to advanced ai

and natural language functionality and

this helps healthcare providers to gain

deeper understandings of their patient

data part of the secret sauce lies in

lookers in database architecture and the

semantic layer which makes it possible

for business users to trust data no

matter how they experience it via a

dashboard email or text alert or even a

custom application

we are excited for these recent

innovations but we couldn't do this

alone together with our community of

customers partners and developers we are

delivering innovation across a variety

of use cases we are able to create new

solutions and accelerate your journey to

transform data into value
