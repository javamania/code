BRIAN RICE: Hi, everybody.

I hope you're enjoying
Google Cloud Next so far.

In this session, we're
going to talk to you

about the value of
getting a Google Cloud

certification to help
you in your career

and to help advance the
projects that you're

involved in in the world
of cloud computing.

My name is Brian Rice, and
I work on Google's Cloud's

Learning Portfolio Team.

And I'm joined today
by my colleague, Osaze.

OSAZE IMASUEN: Hello, everyone.

My name is Osaze Imasuen.

And I'm a technical
program manager

in Google Global Networking.

Really excited to be here and
looking forward to this talk.

BRIAN RICE: Thank you so much.

Here's the way we're going to
structure our session today.

I'm going to kick it off
by talking about the roles

that are out there
in the world of cloud

computing and their demand and
how that's shaping and changing

as we move further and
further into the cloud era.

I'm going to talk about
the learning resources

that Google Cloud
makes available to help

people achieve a wide range of
Google Cloud certifications.

Then I'm going to
bring on Osaze.

And he's going to tell us
about how certifications helped

him propel his career path.

Finally, we'll wrap
it up by talking

about the benefits of
Google Cloud certifications,

both to the people
who achieve them

and to the teams that
they're a part of.

Let's start off by talking about
the demand for cloud computing

roles.

We recently did a
survey where leaders

were asked about the barriers
that they had to cloud success.

And over 80% of them identified
a skills gap on their team

as a top barrier.

And this is a really
significant problem

if you think about the fact that
more than 90% of those leaders

expect to have increased use
of cloud over the next three

years.

This tells us that skills are
a critical factor in companies'

move to the cloud.

And we know it's of growing
importance to the cloud

community, because job
postings that were specifically

calling for cloud skills
grew by more than 40%

over the two years that ended
in the first quarter of 2021.

And of course, there
was a lot of change

and a lot of upheaval
over that period.

This significant growth
tells us about the fact

that skills are fuel for
companies moving into the cloud

and revolutionizing
the way they work.

We at Google Cloud are
especially proud of the fact

that, in a survey conducted
by Global Knowledge,

the top two paying IT
certifications in the year 2021

in the US were both Google
Cloud certifications.

We take this both as testimonial
to the value of Google Cloud

itself and also to
the programs that we

offer for recognizing
people's skills

and helping people train
themselves up so that they

can achieve those credentials.

Now, cloud computing
always requires an approach

to learning and credentialing
that is focused on job roles.

After all, the roles
that people play

is how people get value
out of cloud computing.

Google Cloud technology training
is aimed at cloud solutions

rather than following
particular products boundaries.

And it's key to the solutions
that customers tried to pursue,

which was their
reason for getting

into the cloud in
the first place.

Now I'd like to talk with you
about the resources that we

make available to
help people skill up

and the certifications that
we make available to recognize

people's skill levels.

Now, when you're leading
a team of professionals,

you have to keep in
mind that people are all

starting in different places.

Everybody on a team
starts with a wide variety

of existing skill levels.

Also, people have different
preferred learning styles.

The same kind of
learning experience

doesn't work for everybody.

So that's why we offer a wide
variety of choices for people

consuming our offerings.

Some people prefer
to consume training

in a traditional
classroom-style format,

either with a live instructor
or with virtual instructor-led

training.

We have a worldwide network of
authorized training partners

that does just that.

Other learners want the
increased convenience

and flexibility of
consuming online training

with virtual lectures
and online assessments.

In order to help these
people, we make our training

available in online
channels as well,

with online training partners.

Both of those two modes
contain the same hands-on labs,

in which people can gain real
world skills using real Google

Cloud, not a simulation, that
gives them the confidence

to do new things on the job.

Finally, some learners want a
maximum amount of flexibility.

They want a la carte
learning, snackable learning.

That's why we also make
available a wide portfolio

of hands-on lab exercises that
can be consumed individually

in a safe sandbox environment.

Now, all of these
lead up to achieving

professional and
associate-level certifications.

These are benchmarks that a team
can adopt to bring everybody up

to a baseline of skill.

That's how they know they
have the right foundation

for innovating and
for scaling up.



Now, the benchmark concept
is very, very important

in the way we build
our certifications.

Their content is defined
by subject matter experts.

And they're key
to real-world job

roles and the uses to which
people put Google Cloud

technology.

That's why Google
Cloud certifications

have significant benefit
not just to individuals,

but to companies as well.

They're a well defined set
of skills that fuels growth.



There's a wide variety
of certifications,

because we know that people
start at different points

and because we know
that people have

a wide variety of interests.

The certifications range
from being targeted

at people with no
prior cloud skills

or experience all the way up
to people who have three years

or more of industry experience
and in a wide variety

of subject matter areas.

Our certifications are organized
into three main categories.

Two of these categories contain
certifications that are aimed

at hands-on technical
professionals--

the associate-level and
the professional-level

certifications.

Here's the difference.

Associate-level certifications,
such as Associate Cloud

Engineer, challenge the
candidate for the cert to map

from technical requirements
to the way a customer would

implement a solution.

The professional level
of certifications

introduces one more layer,
challenging the candidate

to map from business
requirements,

through technical requirements,
to the details of the way

the customer
implementation would work.

Finally, our credential
that is aimed

at anyone involved in
or impacted by the move

to the cloud, Cloud
Digital Leader,

contains three main bodies
of knowledge that it covers--

general cloud
knowledge, knowledge

of Google Cloud in
particular, and awareness

of the business value
and role of a variety

of important Google
Cloud Services.



Let me give you more
information about the exams

that we make available.

They're a two-hour experience.

And they're offered
in a multiple choice

and multiple select format.

The exams don't
have prerequisites

in that you are not required to
complete any specific training

or any specific
prior certifications

in order to attempt them.

We do recommend that people
have hands-on experience

for our certifications that call
for that in their descriptions.

And we also encourage people
to structure their preparation

and make sure they come
in with the knowledge

that each credential calls for.

But no prerequisites
in the realm

of training or other
certifications are enforced.

The exams are delivered
at your choice

of either a remote
location, in which case

the proctoring for the
exams is done online,

or you can go to a
physical testing center

and take an exam in an
on-site proctored system.

Finally, we make available
official study guides,

in addition to all of
the other resources

that we make available.

These books are available
from major resellers of books.

At this point, I'd
like to bring Osaze on.

Osaze, we wanted to
ask you to join us

today to tell us about
your career journey

through the lens
of certification.

Could I ask you to start off
by telling us about your career

path before the cloud?

OSAZE IMASUEN: Sure, Brian.

So my career has spanned
approximately two decades.

And I've had a variety
of roles, from hands-on

to technical leadership, to
just pure leadership roles.

And I would say
that certifications

and learning and relearning
has been a key component.

It enabled me to
progress through

from being an engineer up
into leadership positions.

Why do I say this?

Early on in my
career, I started out

trying to build
infrastructures for companies

and deliver their IT
solutions internally.

But I found that the moment
I added certifications

and that learning
experience to my journey,

it accelerated, one, my
knowledge, my learning,

and then also my scope
of responsibility.

So it's something that has
worked very well for me

in my career.

And it's something
that I continue

to use and reuse over and over.

BRIAN RICE: Super.

And tell us more about
what happened when you

started moving into the cloud.

OSAZE IMASUEN: Sure.

So before the
journey to the cloud,

my organization would
procure, build, and operate

our own internal resources.

So think of private cloud.

And at some point, we realized
that the cost and also the time

to delivery made us not meet
certain business requirements.

And we had to start looking
at the option of moving

some of those
workloads to the cloud.

Now, we didn't migrate
everything over all in one day.

We started out in a
step by step process

by doing the trial for setting
non-critical workloads first

to get a feel for how things
will operate in the cloud

and also what the security
framework would be,

because that is a
huge consideration

for anyone trying to make
that journey into the cloud.

Over time, as a
team, we got more

confident in using
resources and understanding

the products in the cloud.

We were able to move
even critical workloads

into the cloud.

And one of the
benefits, which I think

is perhaps well-known
in the industry,

is, when you run your
own resources internally,

you most often plan
for peak demand.

And that means that,
a lot of times,

you have resources
idling, not being used,

whereas in the cloud, in
the more pay-per-use model,

you're able to more effectively
use resources and also reduce

your spend if you plan
your resources properly.

BRIAN RICE: Indeed.

Well, to sum up,
can you tell us now

about how certifications played
a role in your own transition

to the cloud?

OSAZE IMASUEN: Sure.

So I've always enjoyed
learning and relearning.

So for me,
certifications help me

focus my attention
over a period of time

to learn that new
technology or learn

whatever is new in that space.

So an example with
Google Cloud is--

over a couple of years,
I was aware of using

Google Cloud platform and
also some other providers.

But when I made that
conscious effort to say,

I'm going to get certified,
it helped focus and narrow

my learning to make sure
that I mastered the content

and understood the
products and offerings

and how they related
to my business.

The end result is I've been
able to achieve certifications

in some of the
professional-level engineer

programs like the Professional
Cloud Architect, Data

Professional, and some of
the other professional-level

certifications.

Why I find these
helpful is it helps

cover a range of topics that are
relevant to the business of IT

and computing today.

And the certification
itself provides knowledge.

That is for sure.

It gives you the
confidence to be

able to interact with either
external or internal peers

or customers.

It also gives you
that confidence.

And, as well, there's
also the Google swag

in terms of the goodies,
the bags, and all

the other nice things
that Google gives you

when you're certified.

BRIAN RICE: So true.

OSAZE IMASUEN: Thank
you so much, Osaze,

for telling us your story.

Now, the last section
of our presentation

is focused on the benefits of
Google Cloud certifications,

both to individuals and to
companies and the ecosystem.

We did a survey in
the beginning of 2020

of people who had achieved
Google Cloud certifications

using an independent
third-party organization.

Of the people that
we surveyed, 78%

said that they had gotten
additional confidence

in their professional
future because they

got this certification.

82% felt like they
now had a special way

to prove their cloud
skill competency

to potential recruiters.

83% felt that their
resume or CV was now

more attractive to
prospective employers.

And finally, 85% said that they
themselves felt more confident

in their cloud skills.

IT leaders have also been
surveyed about the impact

of certification.

Out of those who authorized
training for their teams

within the last 12 months
in a different survey,

2/3 did so specifically
with the aim

of preparing their team
members for certification

or re-certification.

93% of those leaders agreed that
certified employees add value

to their organizations
well beyond the sheer cost

of the certification itself.

How much was that?

Well, 63% of them were
comfortable estimating

that the economic benefit
of those certified employees

was more than
$10,000 USD a year,

which is a significant
increment for what

is comparatively a small
investment in skills

and knowledge.

As Osaze mentioned, there's
a wide variety of benefits

for getting certification.

And some of them are swag.

Folks who achieve our
professional-level

certifications do get
excellent merchandise

that allows them to show off
their credentials in public.

Everybody gets a
digital badge that they

can put on their
profiles on social media

and display in other ways.

Professional-level
certified people

also get access to special
events at Google Cloud

Next and other venues.

They get access to the Google
Cloud certified community

so that they can exchange
ideas and knowledge

with other certified people
and seek out networking

opportunities as well.

Now, this talk
wouldn't be complete

if we didn't have
something new to present.

In order to help the
broad ecosystem get

more cloud and
Google Cloud skills,

today we are announcing
Google Cloud skills boost.

It's a brand new way to
consume Google Cloud learning.

It makes more than 700
labs, courses, and tools

for preparing for our
certifications available.

And for the next
month, we're making

it available to all of
our customers and partners

at no cost.

The URL is
g.co/cloud/freetraining.

And we hope that
everybody listening

will take advantage
of this offer

and see what we are
making available to help

people take their careers
to the next level.

At this point, I
want to thank Osaze

for joining us today and
telling us his story.

And I'd like to thank everyone
in the audience for joining us.

And we wish you all the best
with your cloud careers.
