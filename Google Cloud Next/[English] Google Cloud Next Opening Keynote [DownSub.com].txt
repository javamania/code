ALISON WAGONFELD: Hi, everyone.

I'm Alison Wagonfeld
with Google Cloud.

Welcome to Google Cloud Next.

And thank you to our
Google orchestra,

composed of Bay Area Googlers.

We are coming to you live
from our Google Cloud

campus in Silicon Valley,
where I'm here with Sundar

Pichai and Thomas Kurian.

We have an incredible lineup
over the next three days

with live keynotes,
demos, and Q&A

with our leadership
in over 140 sessions

covering all our
cloud solutions.

Our customers and
partners will share

how they're using Google Cloud
and Google Workspace technology

to tackle their greatest
challenges and opportunities.

We are humbled to support their
work and share their stories.

Thank you for
being here with us.

And now, please join me in
welcoming Google and Alphabet

CEO, Sundar Pichai.

SUNDAR PICHAI: Hi, everyone.

Welcome to Google
Cloud Next 2021.

We are happy you're here.

Of course, I'd be happier
if we could actually

be here in person.

Don't get me wrong,
Thomas is great company.

But he still doesn't laugh
at my container jokes.

So while many of us are still
waiting for a return to normal,

it does feel like
we are on our way.

The question is, will
we recognize normal

when we get there?

The pandemic has
sped up digitization

in all aspects of our lives.

It's changed how
we visit a doctor,

how our kids learn
in school, and how

we connect with one another.

And it's made the future
of work our present,

giving us renewed opportunity
to transform our organizations.

From our work with
customers, Thomas and I

have learned there are three
things that position us to be

most helpful to businesses--

first, our Cloud
platform, it's designed

to help enterprises transform
through digitization,

built on the deep
investments we've

made in technical infrastructure
over the past 23 years.

Looking at our networking and
data center investments alone,

we have the largest network with
the lowest latency of any cloud

provider.

With our expansions into Warsaw,
Delhi, Melbourne, and Toronto

this year, we now have 28
regions with plans for 10 more.

And it's all connected
by 19 sub-sea cables.

Our Grace Hopper
transatlantic cable

will be the first to incorporate
novel optical fiber switching.

Second, our enterprise customers
benefit from our consumer scale

and innovation.

We have a deep and
broad consumer ecosystem

of devices and services.

YouTube connects
a global community

of viewers and creators.

Android, Nest,
Assistant, and Maps

are loved by people
around the world.

We have the unique ability to
connect consumer ecosystems

with enterprise ecosystems.

For example, the realistic
voices and language

understanding that
powers Google Assistant

can improve enterprise
customer experiences

and increase satisfaction.

And the underlying
visual technology

that enables Google Lens to
help people shop or learn

about a new flower
in their garden

can help manufacturers
identify defects.

Third, we offer
comprehensive security

that helps organizations,
including ours,

protect what matters.

Security is foundational
to everything we do.

We have a long
history of building it

into every layer of the
computing environment.

We are a pioneer of
zero trust computing

and have deep experience
running this model at scale.

On its own, any one
of these pillars

would be helpful to customers.

Put together, they can
be transformative, which

is the mission of Google Cloud.

We continue to drive innovation
through our products.

Over the past year, we have
had more than 1,500 product

and feature releases.

That's about four a day.

They're all designed
to be helpful,

from Smart Canvas and
Google Workspace that

makes collaboration
richer, to new AI powered

industry solutions and BigQuery
Omni for data analytics

across any cloud.

We've also made significant
partnership announcements.

For example, we teamed up
with global telecom leaders,

such as Ericsson, Nokia, and
T-Systems to deliver 5G edge

and hosted computing solutions.

What I'm most
excited about is how

our strengths in cloud,
consumer, and security

are helping top
enterprises accelerate

their transformation.

Ford chose Google as their
transformation partner

because of our strength
in consumer and cloud.

Together, we are innovating in
electrification, connectivity,

and self-driving technologies.

Ford is harnessing Google
Maps to help drivers navigate,

Google Assistant to help
drivers concentrate,

and Google Play to keep
passengers learning

and entertained.

L'Oreal partnered
across Google to build

a virtual try-on experience.

They are harnessing
the best AI models,

as well as using YouTube to
build a community of fans,

and Google Shopping to make
it easy to discover and buy

their products.

We are humbled that so many
organizations continue to put

their trust in Google Cloud.

And we are committed to
helping you solve the biggest

challenges you face.

I'll be back a little later to
talk more about how we do that.

But first, I'll
turn the stage over

to Thomas Kurian,
CEO of Google Cloud

to talk more about our mission.

THOMAS KURIAN:
Thank you, Sundar.

Hello, everyone.

It's a pleasure to be here on
Google's Silicon Valley campus

today for the moment we've
all looked forward to all year

long, the opportunity
to connect with you,

our customers, partners,
and developers,

and to share all the
amazing, exciting stuff we've

been working on.

A special thank you
to all our sponsors,

especially our luminary
sponsors, Accenture, Atos,

Maven Wave, and Deloitte.

Let's first hear from
some of our customers

about the amazing
ways in which they

have accelerated transformation
with Google Cloud.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

- The pandemic
really did accelerate

the digital wave of change by
easily three to five years.

- We transitioned
to all virtual care.

- We're better
positioned to accelerate.

- Fast forward to today,
we have a truly profound,

permanent structural
transformation.

- Now, our team can look
at hundreds of calls

in minutes instead of weeks.

- Our business has
really been transformed

with the help of Google Cloud.

We have spikes in demand.

We can scale four times
in less than five minutes.

- Schrodinger is transforming
the way scientists

are developing drugs.

Chemical space is
almost infinite.

We can do things we
couldn't do before.

- Can't I just
track my shipment?

We think that we can help solve
that for the supply chain.

- How can we help workers
with artificial intelligence?

- Suddenly, lots of
ideas become interesting.

- We're very excited to develop
our artificial intelligence

and machine learning.

- Access to innovation,
the speed of innovation.

- Seconds, milliseconds
all matter.

- We're rethinking routine
and pioneering simplicity.

- The partnership
with Google Cloud

provides us with technology
that will drive us to be better.



[END PLAYBACK]

Now, it's not a secret that
many of the biggest and most

innovative technology companies,
leaders such as Spotify,

Twitter, Shopify, MercadoLibre,
ShareChat, Dapper Labs,

and so many other exciting
startups and tech leaders

choose Google Cloud to help
them build, scale, and innovate.

Still, other customers
are transforming

using our purpose-built
industry solutions.

The Home Depot,
for instance, used

contact center AI to
reduce customer resolution

time by 91 million minutes.

Procter & Gamble
creates personalized

omnichannel journeys from over
275 million consumer records.

IKEA Retail use
recommendations AI

to increase e-commerce
click-through rates by 30%

and increase order value by 2%.

FIH, a Foxconn company,
used visual inspection

to identify defects 10
times more accurately.

Mr. Cooper, a leading
mortgage services provider,

used document AI to process
mortgage documents 400% more

efficiently.

And Bank of New York Mellon
developed a liquidity solution

that predicts nearly 40% of
securities settlement failures

with 90% accuracy.

We're helping many businesses
drive durable innovation

through long-term partnerships
with Google's transformation

cloud.

Now, to help them transform,
we focus on five key themes.

One, are we the best at
understanding and using

data in the industry?

Two, do we have the
industry's leading technology

infrastructure?

Three, are we creating
the best hybrid workplace

for our passionate and
talented employees?

Four, do we know that our data,
systems, and users are secure

now and that they will
be secure in the future?

And five, are we
working together

to address the most
important challenges facing

our world today?

We help organizations address
these important questions.

Let's Start.

With the first question.

Are we the best at understanding
and using data in the industry?

We help organizations
unify their data

across multiple
clouds and silos,

combining structured
and unstructured data,

and making data every
employee's superpower.

Using data analytics
and AI together,

Schrodinger accelerated
clinical drug discovery by 60%,

finding new
breakthroughs faster.

Like many states around
the United States,

the Wisconsin Department
of Workforce Development

confronted a wave of
new unemployment claims.

Using Google's data cloud, they
clear over 750,000 unemployment

claims, reducing claim times
from weeks to just days

and dispersing over $2 billion
in unemployment benefits.

Walmart is transforming
the experience

for the approximately
220 million shoppers

around the globe who visit
a Walmart store, club,

or e-commerce website each week.

I'm honored today to welcome
Suresh Kumar, executive vice

president, Walmart's global
chief technology officer,

and chief development officer.

SURESH KUMAR: Hi, Thomas.

And hello, everyone.

I'm excited to be
here today to share

about how we at Walmart
are innovating on behalf

of our customers, our
associates, and the role

that our partners like
you, Google, have played

in our innovation journey.

Now, I came to Walmart at a
time of incredible digital

transformation and,
jointly with my team,

created a robust execution
plan to accelerate

the transformation
across three areas--

building great
customer experiences,

optimizing our business,
and modernizing our platform

and our infrastructure.

Each of these three priorities
are individually important.

But when you bring them
together at the scale

of a business like Walmart,
it has a massive impact.

If you move with speed,
you can completely

transform global operations
and disrupt entire industries.

Some of our most data intensive,
our critical decisioning

processes are getting
the BigQuery treatment.

Through this, not only are we
seeing significant savings that

will continue as we migrate
more and more data over,

we are also seeing the
ability to use the data

in interesting ways, including
enabling analytics at scale

and turning data into
actionable insights.

From a data migration
to BigQuery standpoint,

97% of the tables used
for data warehouse

have already migrated
to the cloud.

And 30% of the big data have
been migrated with plans

to almost double that by
the end of this fiscal year.

And the cherry on the
top is that BigQuery

has allowed us to integrate
with pretty much any data

visualization tool and analytics
tools that's out there,

thereby improving our processing
time by 23% and, of course,

needless to say, a
much better experience.

Using BigQuery has had a
direct impact on our business.

An excellent example
is our ability

to close our financial
books in three days instead

of five days.

And that's a pretty big deal.

Leveraging our
cloud has enabled us

to unleash the potential of
AI across our entire business.

This goes from
predicting demand,

to managing in stock levels,
to optimizing supply chain,

to freeing up time
for our associates

to serve our customers.

As one example,
Express Delivery,

which is our two
hour delivery service

which we launched
last year, actively

uses it behind the
scenes as our customer

is creating their order.

Multiple algorithms
work in unison

to optimize the deliveries
out and determine

if the customer is eligible
for Express Delivery.

We are building our own
AI and ML capabilities

to power multiple
areas of our business,

including classification,
natural language processing,

forecasting, regression,
computer vision, predictions,

process automations,
and a whole lot more.

So to wrap up, I'm really
excited about the opportunity

Walmart has to drive
innovation and to further

disrupt the retail industry.

I hope you'll agree
that our work together

is making a huge difference
for our customers

and our associates.

Thank you for having me.

THOMAS KURIAN:
Thank you, Suresh.

Tens of thousands of incredible
organizations like Walmart

choose Google's data
cloud for four reasons.

First, Google's data cloud is
the most complete and unified

data and AI platform to help you
manage every stage of the data

lifecycle.

From running
operational transactions

to developing
analytical applications,

we help customers unify
data lakes and warehouses

as data lake houses,
to reduce complexity,

and to combine structured
and unstructured data.

Built-in data science and AI
with support for MapReduce,

Spark, and Presto enables
continuous learning

and experimentation.

And we support
real-time streaming

that natively uses open source
standards, like Beam and Flink.

Google's data Cloud is also
unmatched for speed, scale,

security, and reliability.

BigQuery, one of the most
successful and beloved data

warehouse solutions, with its
unique serverless approach,

during a typical week
helps more than 3,000

different organizations
analyze more than 200 petabytes

of data.

And thousands of
customers use Dataproc

to run Spark in Hadoop
clusters easily.

Spanner, a fully managed
relational database

with unlimited scale and
multi-zone and multi-region

consistency, serves more than
1 billion requests per second

and provides a 5-9 SLA.

Google data Cloud's
Vertex AI offers

the AI-pioneered at Google
Research and Deepmind

so that every data scientist
and ML engineer can now

build, deploy, and scale AI
models faster and with 80% less

code using AI the
same way Google does.

For instance, GE Appliances, an
appliance manufacturing leader

for more than a century, is
using Google Cloud including

AI The Edge to build
innovative digital products

with over-the-air updates.

Finally, Google's data cloud
is more open standards-based.

You can choose from Postgres,
MySQL, Redis, MongoDB,

or migrate from
Oracle or SQL server.

And we have strategic
partners with leading

data-driven applications.

For instance, C3 AI has
made its entire lineup

of AI-based applications
available on Google Cloud.

Our customers can analyze,
govern, and visualize data

from many databases and
storage systems on Google

or other clouds, including
all of Google's databases,

Google Sheets,
and BigQuery using

Looker, our premier BI and
embedded analytics solution.

Today, we're
thrilled and excited

to announce that we'll
be integrating Tableau,

a leader in data
visualization, with Looker,

Google Sheets, and BigQuery.

Tableau customers will
soon be able to use

Looker's semantic model,
enabling new levels of data

governance and access to data.

Let's take a look at this.

Alex, over to you.



ALEKSANDRA ALEKSIC:
Thank you, Thomas.

In this demo, we're going to
show you how you can seamlessly

use Looker and Tableau
together to answer

your critical
business questions.

Let's say I work at
an e-commerce company.

And our Looker model
provides a consistent view

across the organization for
our most important business

metrics.

Here, for example, you
can see the definition

for gross margin.

Our Looker dashboard is based
on that same semantic model.

Since it provides trusted
insights at a glance,

I can immediately see
that sales are up.

However, did I miss anything?

Let's find out.

Say I'm more comfortable
working in spreadsheets.

I can now take advantage of the
new integration between Looker

and Google Sheets.

With a couple of clicks, I
have access to my governed

and trusted Looker
data in Sheets.

And I can easily connect
to my data models.

To understand which factors
are impacting sales,

I'll drag and drop fields from
my model into a pivot table

to break out sales by
category over time.

Since it's pulling
from Looker, I

can trust that all the data
definitions are consistent.

I can use familiar Sheets
formulas and formatting

to get insights faster
and understand how

specific products are selling.

We see a notable
downward trend month

over month for activewear.

I want to share these findings
with my marketing team, who's

using Tableau.

Now, I can use the new
Tableau and Looker integration

to combine data from my Looker
data model with marketing data

to build a more comprehensive
view of my business.

Next, I'm going to
plot sales by category

and then add marketing
spend to the view.

Tableau makes it easy for me
to drill down on relevant data.

Now, I can see that
social marketing

spend was significantly
lower for activewear.

And this is why there's a
downward trend in activewear

sales.

I'm going to publish this
result on Tableau Online

and tag my marketing team,
so they can take action.

Leveraging integrations between
Tableau, Sheets, and Looker

allows our teams to build
powerful visualizations

using trusted data.

We can then share
these visualizations

throughout our organization
to drive informed decisions,

action, and impact.

Back over to you, Thomas.



THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, Alex.

The second question
customers ask--

do we have industry-leading
technology infrastructure?

We're experiencing
great momentum

with our open
infrastructure cloud.

Many of the most demanding
and technically advanced

customers in the world
disproportionately choose us.

Take, for example, leading
media companies and streaming

services, such as
Univision and Global,

the largest media
group in Latin America.

They use our high performance
networking, computing,

and storage to broadcast
media, including

live events, such as the
recent Tokyo Olympics.

Leading telecommunications
companies

are also choosing Google Cloud.

Reliance Jio, the world's
second largest mobile carrier,

is automating its 5G network.

Vodafone is processing
over a billion network

events each day.

AT&T is delivering new
multi-access edge computing

solutions.

And Tellus is migrating critical
IT and network workloads

all to Google Cloud.

Leading data
management companies,

including Databricks, Redis,
Cockroach Labs, Couchbase,

Elastic, InfluxData, MariaDB,
MongoDB, Neo4j, and SingleStore

are all growing faster on Google
Cloud than on any other cloud.

And they love our
storage scalability

and advanced infrastructure.

MongoDB, for instance,
has more net new customers

via Google Cloud Marketplace
than on any other cloud.

Leading cybersecurity companies,
such as Palo Alto Networks,

[INAUDIBLE] Splunk,
Broadcom, and ForgeRock

are also choosing Google
Cloud for its performance,

global scale, and
underlying security.

Customers are migrating and
transforming SAP and VMware

workloads to Google Cloud.

In just the last year, we've
added three times the number

of SAP customers
as the prior year.

And we're accelerating.

PayPal, for instance, has
an SAP HANA scale-out system

supporting 40 million
business transactions daily,

200 billion records
touched in just 30 seconds.

Mitel in Canada migrated over
1,000 VMware virtual machines

in less than 90 days to
Google Cloud VMware Engine.

Nylas, an API platform company,
chose our Tau virtual machines

along with Google
Kubernetes Engine,

as they saw over 40%
better price performance

than in a competitor.

Customers choose our
open cloud Infrastructure

for three main reasons.

First, we make your path
to migrate and modernize

using cloud easy with
migration tools, new serverless

and container capabilities,
and managed services

as your developers
spend more time building

experiences that
your customers love.

Second, we offer
transformative capabilities

with cutting edge
performance and security.

And our network
offers three times

the throughput of
other cloud providers.

Third, we remain, and were,
the very first and only cloud

provider with a clear
multi-cloud strategy.

We provide you with a
consistent developer experience

built in open source to write
once and deploy anywhere.

Many customers, like Plaid,
a financial services leader,

use Anthos to deploy, operate,
and manage applications

across multiple clouds.

Recently, we introduced
Anthos for virtual machines,

standardizing the
way that you manage

applications across both
virtual machines and containers.

For multi-cloud
data, BigQuery Omni

lets customers analyze data
across Google Cloud, AWS,

and Azure.

With it, Johnson &
Johnson, for instance,

was able to combine data
in Google Cloud and AWS-3

using BigQuery Omni without
needing to migrate data.

Customers also want
to expand where

they use Google Cloud, whether
in their private data centers

or out on the edge.

For instance, some workloads
cannot move to the public cloud

entirely due to the need for
large amounts of local data

processing, extremely low
latency, or strict regulations.

To solve these challenges,
we're announcing today

Google Distributed Cloud,
a portfolio of hardware

and software solutions that
extend our infrastructure

to the edge and even into
your own data center.

To tell you more about
it, please welcome Ines

from our Google Cloud
Distributed cloud team.

INES ENVI: Thank you, Thomas.

Google Distributed
Cloud is a set

of fully managed services
running on Google's managed

hardware.

Based on open APIs
and built on Anthos,

it gives customers greater
deployment flexibility

and ensures more
consistent operations

across hybrid and multi-cloud
environments, more

than any other Cloud provider.

There are four
deployment scenarios,

depending on your
specific needs.

Google's network edge,
this allows customers

to leverage over
140 network edge

locations around the world.

Operator edge, this
scenario is designed

to accommodate emerging
services and applications

with stringent latency and
reliability requirements

for a specific operator.

Customer edge, this scenario
supports customer-owned edge

locations, such as retail
stores, factory floors,

or branch offices, which
require localized compute

and processes.

And finally, customer
data centers--

this deployment option is
specific to customer-owned data

centers and call facilities.

Google Distributed Cloud
also includes a hosted mode

to run sensitive
workloads and address

data sovereignty, security,
and privacy requirements.

It does not require connectivity
to Google Cloud at any time

to manage infrastructure,
services, APIs, or tooling.

You have the choice
to manage it yourself

or host through a
designated trusted partner.

Back to you, Thomas.



THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, Ines.

Partners like HPE,
Dell, Cisco, and NetApp

are key as we deploy Google
Distributed Cloud globally

on best in class hardware.

I'm pleased to announce the
expansion of our partnership

with Network Appliance
in two important ways.

First, NetApp is
our primary partner

supporting Google's Distributed
Cloud storage infrastructure.

Second, for customers using
Google Cloud VMware Engine,

they now have preview access
for NetApp Cloud Volumes.

We are the only hyperscale
to provide customers

with this choice.

Deep partnerships with
T-Systems systems and Telus

have also enabled us to address
the evolving sovereignty

requirements for cloud
technology in Germany

and France.

The next question we hear is,
how can we provide the best

environment to help
employees create and innovate

together, especially
in a hybrid workplace?

Hybrid is redefining
how we all work,

making it less
about where we work,

but more about the
quality of our experience.

Studies estimate that
more than 48% of employees

will work remotely post-COVID.

Google Workspace is
the best platform

for hybrid work with simple,
powerful, and secure tools

to help people communicate and
collaborate with one another,

no matter where they are.

We introduced Smart Canvas to
help content creators remove

friction from
workflows and enable

teams to stay connected
outside of meetings,

to foster well-being, and
reduce video call fatigue.

We made communication
and collaboration

completely seamless.

For instance, users can
easily present and collaborate

in meetings, create meeting
notes from their calendar,

present in Meet directly
from Docs, Sheets, or Slides,

and collaborate directly
from Chat and Spaces.

We optimized collaboration
from all mobile devices

to provide great experiences for
frontline workers who make up

80% of the global workforce.

One of America's largest
hospital systems,

CommonSpirit Health, is
advancing its mission

during the pandemic by
making its frontline doctors

and nurses productive
at Google Workspace.

Since hybrid work has
removed the notion

of a physical location
for work, Google Workspace

created spaces, a unified
digital location for work.

Today, more than 3 billion users
move security and seamlessly

between Mail, Chat, Audio,
Video, and now Spaces.

And you too can choose among
the over 5,300 public apps

in our marketplace.

And you can also add
thousands of private apps

to enhance your workspace.

And I want to step
aside for just a minute

and tell you about a hidden
secret in our portfolio

of products, AppSheet,
our notebook platform that

makes it easy for everyone, not
just professional developers,

to build amazing
apps and workflows.

For instance, property managers
at [INAUDIBLE] Properties

used AppSheet to
build a mobile app,

to log, track, and resolve
problems with headquarters,

replacing a multi-step
manual process.

We're also partnering
with Citrix

because employees sometimes
need access to Windows,

and Mac OS applications,
and desktops directly

served from the Cloud.

We're expanding our
partnership with Citrix

today to deliver an integrated
desktop as a service solution

purpose-built on Google Cloud.

Now, customers ask us, do we
know that our data, systems,

and users are secure?

And how do we keep them
secure in the future?

As more digital users access
more data from more locations,

the risk of cybersecurity
breaches is accelerating.

By pioneering new
approaches to security,

Google keeps more
people safe online

than anyone else in the world.

Take, for instance, JetBlue.

It's keeping its system
secure, protecting

the data of all its travelers,
and modernizing its security

operations using Chronicle
to detect threats

across petabytes of
security telemetry,

eliminating data blind spots.

Commerzbank, one of
Germany's largest banks,

is using a new certificate
authority service

to verify machine and
workload identity,

improving security, simplifying
operations, eliminating

entire classes of threats.

Secure by default
drives customers

to choose Google Cloud.

First, we've
implemented zero trust

at the core of our services
and our operations,

enabling you to trust nothing.

Second, we've built cloud scale
threat detection and response,

allowing you to
detect everything.

And third, we know it's
not just about tools.

We provide the
advisory services you

need to transform
security operations.

We keep customers safe with
BeyondCorp Enterprise, which

enables zero trust
access for all users.

Today, we're
expanding BeyondCorp

to all your applications--
modern and legacy, web

and desktop, and even to
production environments.

We keep customers safe by
eliminating software supply

chain vulnerabilities.

Over the past two decades,
we've pioneered an approach

to secure our own
software supply chain.

We are now making
that technology

available through the
SLSA Open Source Framework

and as managed
services in our Cloud

to help you secure your
own software supply chain.

We keep customers safe by
integrating Chronicle's threat

detection capability with
our Security Command Center,

allowing you to respond
faster to potential risks.

And we keep customers safe by
bringing our security expertise

to you with our Google
Cybersecurity Action Team,

a team of our leading
security experts

who can help shape your
security transformation

from your very
first implementation

through responding
to a major incident

and engineering new
solutions as needs change.

Finally, we continue to
expand our security ecosystem

with companies like Fortinet,
Palo Alto Networks, [INAUDIBLE]

and so many more.

Today, I'd like to
welcome your new security

partner, Cybereason, with
whom we are collaborating

to deliver a new, extended
detection and response

offering that will
combine Chronicle's

capability with
Cybereason's MalOps Engine

for faster, easier threat
detection and response.

Our products, our new
Cybersecurity Action Team,

and our partnerships
all make the world safer

from cyber threats.

To talk more about how we help
keep each and every one of you

secure and how we're
addressing some

of the most important
challenges facing our world,

I'd like to invite Sundar back.

Thank you.

SUNDAR PICHAI:
Thank you, Thomas.

Security is top of mind for
businesses of all sizes,

as well as the public sector.

And despite the progress that
has been made in cybersecurity,

large scale breaches
continue to make headlines.

That's why, in August,
Google announced

we will invest $10 billion
over the next five years

to strengthen cybersecurity.

That includes expanding
zero trust programs,

helping secure the
software supply chain,

and enhancing open
source security.

A new challenge is
keeping collaboration

secure and private, as we move
to hybrid work environments.

To help, we are introducing
a new Work Safer program.

It provides the highest level
of security for your email,

meetings, messaging, and
more, and brings together

Google Workspace with Titan
Security Keys, BeyondCorp,

and other secure technologies,
products, and partners.

Now, every kind of
organization in business

can access the same
security protections

that make work safer at Google.

Security is an issue
that affects us all.

And this brings us to the
last question Thomas posed.

Are we addressing the
most important challenges

facing our world?

Climate change is one of
the most profound challenges

we face.

It'll take all of us working
together to solve it.

Sustainability has been
a core value for us

for more than two decades.

Google has been carbon
neutral since 2007.

And we've matched our operations
with 100% renewable energy

over four consecutive years.

Last year, we set out to make
our third decade of climate

action our biggest yet.

That included a bold
commitment to operate

on 24/7 carbon free energy
across our offices and data

centers by 2030.

And last week, we
announced new ways

we are helping 1 billion people
make more sustainable choices.

When it comes to
enterprises, one

of the most important
sustainability choices

is where to run your technology.

IDC predicts cloud migrations
over the next four years

could reduce carbon emissions
by over 1 billion metric tons

or the equivalent of
removing 200 million cars

off the road for a year.

We are proud that Google
Cloud is the cleanest cloud

in the industry.

Earlier this year, we
introduced a way for customers

to choose the cleanest regions
to run their workloads.

Today, we are
expanding our portfolio

of solutions and partnerships
to help reduce your carbon

footprint.

First, we have focused on
giving you greater transparency

around carbon emissions data.

We are announcing Carbon
Footprint, a new service

to measure, track, and
report the gross carbon

emissions associated with
your Google Cloud usage.

Having this data at your
fingertips is really important.

And we know that many customers
track sustainability data

in other places.

That's why I'm happy to announce
that Google Cloud Emission

Data will integrate directly
into Salesforce Sustainability

Cloud.

We also want to give you the
tools to act on the data.

So today, we are
introducing a new tool

that will alert you when
you have idle workloads

and make recommendations
to reduce carbon emissions.

It's all part of
our goal to help

make your Cloud transformation
secure and sustainable

and solve for what's next.

So on behalf of
Thomas and myself,

let me thank you once
again for trusting

us to be a partner with
you on this journey.

And we hope you enjoy
the next three days.

Thank you.
