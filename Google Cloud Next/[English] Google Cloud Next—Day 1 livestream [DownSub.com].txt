Welcome to Google Cloud NEXT, 

and thank you to our Google 

orchestra composed of bay area 

Googlers.

orchestra, composed of Bay Area 

We're coming to you live from 

our Google Cloud campus in 

Silicon Valley, where I'm here 

with Sundar Pichai and Thomas 

Kurian!

opportunities.

We're humbled to support their 

work and share their stories.

Thank you for being here with 

us.

Now please join me in welcoming 

Google and Alphabet CEO, Sundar 

Pichai! 

>>SUNDAR PICHAI: Hi, everyone.

Welcome to Google Cloud Next 

2021.

We're happy you're here.

Of course, I'd be happier if you

could actually be here, in 

person.

Don't get me wrong, Thomas is 

Great company, but he still

doesn't laugh at my container 

jokes.

So while many of us are still 

waiting for a return to normal, 

it does feel like we're on our 

way.

The question is, will we 

recognize normal when we get 

there? 

The pandemic has sped up 

digitization in all aspects of 

our lives.

It's changed how we visit the 

doctor, how our kids learn in 

school, and how we connect with 

one another.

And it's made the future of work

our present, giving us renewed 

opportunity to transform our 

organizations.

From our work with customers, 

Thomas and I have learned there 

are three things that position 

us to be most helpful to 

businesses: First, our Cloud 

platform.

It's designed to help 

enterprises transform through 

digitization, built on the deep 

investments we've made in 

technical infrastructure over 

the past 23 years.

Looking at our networking and 

data center investments alone, 

we have the largest network with

the lowest-latency of any Cloud 

provider.

With our expansions into Warsaw,

Delhi, Melbourne and Toronto 

this year, we now have 28 

regions, with plans for ten 

more.

And it's all connected by 19 

subsea cables.

Our Grace Hopper trans-Atlantic 

cable will be the first to 

incorporate novel optical fiber 

switching.

Second, our enterprise customers

Benefit from our consumer scale 

and innovation.

We have a deep and broad 

consumer ecosystem of devices 

and services.

YouTube connects a global 

community of viewers and 

creators.

Android, Nest, Assistant, and 

Maps are loved by people around 

the world.

We have the unique ability to 

connect consumer ecosystems with

enterprise ecosystems.

For example, the realistic 

voices and language 

understanding that powers Google

Assistant can improve enterprise

customer experiences and 

increase satisfaction.

And the underlying visual 

technology that enables Google 

Lens to help people shop or 

Learn about a new flower in 

their garden can help 

manufacturers identify defects.

Third, we offer comprehensive 

security that helps 

organizations, including ours, 

protect what matters.

Security is foundational to 

everything we do.

We have a long history of 

building it into every layer of 

the computing environment.

We're a pioneer of zero-trust 

computing, and have deep 

experience running this model at

scale.

On its own, any one of these 

pillars would be helpful to 

customers.

Put together, they can be 

transformative, which is the 

mission of Google Cloud.

We continue to drive innovation 

through our products.

Over the past year, we've had 

more than 1,500 product and 

feature releases.

That's about four a day.

They're all designed to be 

helpful, from Smart Canvas in 

Google Workspace that makes 

collaboration richer, to new 

AI-powered industry solutions, 

and Big Query Omni for data 

analytics across any Cloud.

We've also made significant 

partnership announcements.

For example, we teamed up with 

global telecom leaders such as  

Ericsson, Nokia and T-Systems to

deliver 5G edge and hosted 

computing solutions.

What I'm most excited about is 

how our strengths in Cloud, 

Consumer and Security are 

helping top enterprises 

accelerate their transformation.

Ford chose Google as their 

transformation partner because 

of our strength in consumer and 

cloud.

Together, we're innovating in 

electrification, connectivity 

and self-driving technologies.

Ford is harnessing Google Maps 

to help drivers navigate, Google

Assistant to help drivers 

concentrate, and Google Play to 

keep passengers learning and 

entertained.

L'Oreal partnered across Google 

to build a virtual try-on 

experience.

They are harnessing the best AI 

models as well as YouTube to 

build a community of fans, and 

Google Shopping to make it easy 

to discover and buy their 

products.

We are humbled that so many

organizations continue to put 

their trust in Google Cloud.

And we are committed to helping 

you solve the biggest challenges

you face.

I'll be back a little later to 

talk more about how we do that.

But first, I'll turn the stage 

over to Thomas Kurian, CEO of 

Google Cloud, to talk more about

our vision.

>>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, 

Sundar! 

Hello, everyone.

It is a pleasure to be here on 

Google's Silicon Valley campus 

today for the moment we all look

forward to all yearlong, the 

opportunity to connect with you,

our customers, partners and 

developers, and to share all the

amazing, exciting stuff we've 

been working on.

A special thank you to all our 

sponsors, especially our 

Luminary Sponsors, Accenture, 

Atos/Maven Wave, and Deloitte.

Let's first hear from some of 

our customers about the amazing 

ways in which they have 

accelerated transformation with 

Google Cloud.

>> The pandemic really did 

accelerate the digital wave of 

change by easily three to five 

years.

>> We transitioned to all 

virtual care.

>> We're better positioned to 

accelerate.

>> Cross over to today, we have 

a truly profound permanent 

structural transformation.

>> Now our team with look at 

hundreds of calls in minutes 

instead of weeks.

>> Our business has really been 

transformed with the help of 

Google Cloud.

>> We have spikes in demand.

We can scale four times in less 

than five minutes.

>> Transforming the way 

scientists are developing drugs,

chemical spaces almost inspint.

We can do things we couldn't do 

before.

>> We think we can help solve 

that for the supply chain.

>> How can we help workers with 

artificial intelligence? 

>> Suddenly, lots of ideas 

become interesting.

>> We're very excited to develop

our artificial intelligence and 

machine learning.

>> Access to innovation, the 

speed of innovation.

>> We're rethinking, retaining 

and pioneering simplicity.

>> The partnership with Google 

Cloud provides us with 

technology that will drive us to

be better.

>>THOMAS KURIAN: Now, it is not 

a secret that many of the 

biggest and most innovative tech

companies, leaders such as 

Spotify, twitter, Shopify, 

Mercado Libre, ShareChat, Dapper

Labs, and so many other exciting

startups and tech leaders choose

Google Cloud to help them build,

scale and innovate.

Still, other customers are 

transforming

using our purpose-built industry

solutions.

The Home Depot, for instance, 

used contact center AI to reduce

customer

resolution time by 91 million 

minutes.

Procter and Gamble creates 

personalized omni-channel 

journeys from over 275 million 

consumer records.

IKEA Retail used Recommendations

AI to increase eCommerce 

click-thru rates by 30 percent, 

And increase order value by 2 

percent.

FIH, a Foxconn company, used 

Visual Inspection to identify 

defects ten times more 

accurately.

Mr. Cooper, a leading mortgage 

services provider, used Document

AI to process mortgage documents

400 percent more efficiently.

And bank of network Mellon

liquidity solution that predicts

nearly 40 percent of securities 

settlement failures with 90 

percent accuracy.

We are helping MANY businesses 

drive durable innovation through

long-term partnerships with 

Google's Transformation Cloud.

To help them transform, we focus

on five key themes.

One, are we the best at

understanding and using data in 

our industry? 

Two, do we have the 

Industry's leading technology 

infrastructure? 

Three, are we creating the best 

hybrid workplace for our 

passionate and talented 

employees? 

Four, do we know that our data, 

systems and users are secure 

now, and that they will be 

secure in the future? 

And five, are we working 

together to address the most 

important challenges facing our 

world? 

We help organizations address 

these important questions.

Let's start with the first 

question.

Are we the best at understanding

and using data in our industry? 

We help organizations unify 

their data across multiple 

clouds and silos, combine 

unstructured and structured 

Data and making data every

employee's super power.

Using Data Analytics and AI 

together, Schrodinger 

accelerated clinical drug 

discovery by 60 percent finding 

new breakthroughs faster.

Like many states around the 

United States, the Wisconsin 

Department of Workforce 

Development confronted a wave of

new unemployment claims.

Using Google's data cloud, they 

clear over 750,000 unemployment 

claims, reducing claim time from

weeks to days, and disbursing 

over $2 billion in unemployment 

benefits.

Wal-Mart is transforming the 

experience for the approximately

220 million shoppers around the 

globe who visit a Wal-Mart 

store, club or eCommerce Web 

site each week.

I'm honored today to welcome 

Suresh Kumar, executive vice 

president

President, Wal-Mart's Global 

Chief Technology Officer, and 

Chief Development Officer.

>> Hi, Thomas, and hello, 

everyone! 

I'm excited to be here today to 

share about how we at Wal-Mart 

are innovating on behalf of our 

customers, our associates, and 

the role that our partners like 

you, Google, have played in our 

innovation journey.

Now, I came to Wal-Mart at a 

time of incredible digital 

transformation, and jointly with

my team, created a robust 

execution plan to accelerate the

transformation across three 

areas: Building great customer 

experiences, optimizing our 

business, and modernizing our 

platform and our infrastructure.

Each of these three priorities 

are individually important, but 

when you bring them together, in

the scale of a business like 

Wal-Mart, it has a massive 

impact.

If you move at speed, you can 

completely transform global 

operations and disrupt entire 

industries.

Some of our most data intensive 

are critical decisioning process

are getting the big credit 

treatment.

Through this, not only are we 

seeing significant savings like 

we'll continue as we migrate 

more and more data over, we are 

also seeing the ability to use 

the data in interesting ways, 

including enabling analytics at 

scale, and turning data into 

actionable insights.

From a data migration to big 

Query standpoint, 97 percent of

the tables used for data 

warehouse have already migrated 

to the cloud, and 30 percent of 

with plans to almost double that

by the end of this fiscal year.

And the cherry on the top is 

that BigQuery has allowed us to 

integrate with pretty much any 

data visualization tool and 

analytics tool that's out there.

Thereby, improving our 

processing time by 23 percent, 

and, of course, needless to say,

a much better user experience.

Using BigQuery has had a direct 

impact on our business.

And a current example is our 

ability to close our financial 

books in three days instead of 

five days, and that's a pretty 

big deal.

Leveraging our Cloud has enabled

us to unleash the potential of 

AI across our entire business.

This goes from predicting demand

to managing in-stock levels to 

optimizing supply chain, to 

freeing up time for our 

associates to serve our 

customers.

As one example, express delivery

which is our two-hour delivery 

service, which we launched last 

year, actively uses AI behind 

the scenes as the customer is 

creating their order.

Mu

Multiple -- work in unison to

optimize the delivery route and 

determine if the customer is 

eligible for express delivery.

We are building our own AI 

capabilities to power multiple 

areas of our business including 

classification, natural language

processing, forecasting, 

regression, computer vision, 

predictions, process automations

and a whole lot more.

So to wrap up, I'm really 

excited about the opportunity 

Wal-Mart has to drive innovation

and to further disrupt the 

retail industry.

I hope you will agree that our 

work together is making a huge 

difference for our customers and

our associates.

Thank you for having me! 

>>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, 

Suresh.

Tens of thousands of incredible 

organizations, like Wal-Mart, 

choose Google's Data Cloud for 

four reasons: First, Google's 

Data Cloud is the most complete 

and unified data and AI platform

to help you manage every stage 

of the data life cycle, from 

running operational transactions

to developing analytical 

applications.

We help customers unify data 

lakes and warehouses as data 

lakehouses to reduce complexity 

and to combine structured and 

unstructured data.

Built-in Data Science and AI 

with support for MapReduce, 

Spark and Presto enable 

continuous learning and 

experimentation.

And, we support real-time 

streaming that natively uses 

open source standards like Beam 

and Flink.

Google's Data Cloud is unmatched

for speed, scale, security and 

reliability.

BigQuery, one of the most 

successful and beloved data 

warehouse solutions with its 

unique serverless approach, 

during a typical week helps more

than 3,000 different 

organizations analyze more than 

200 petabytes of data.

And thousands of customers use 

Dataproc to run Spark and  

Hadoop clusters easily.

Spanner, a fully managed 

relational database with 

unlimited scale and multi-zone 

and multi-region consistency 

serves more than one billion 

requests per second and provides

a five 9 SLA.

Google Data Cloud's Vertex AI 

offers the AI pioneered at 

Google Research and DeepMind, so

that every data scientist and ML

engineers can build, deploy and 

scale AI Models faster and with 

80 percent less code, using AI 

the same way Google does.

For instance, GE Appliances, an 

appliance manufacturing leader 

for more than a century, is 

using Google Cloud, including AI

at the edge, to build innovative

digital products with 

over-the-air updates.

And finally, Google's Data Cloud

is more open standards-based.

You can choose from Postgres, My

SQL, Redis, MongoDB, or migrate 

from Oracle or SQL Server.

And we have strategic 

Partners with leading

data-driven applications 

.

For instance, C3 AI has made its

entire lineup of AI software 

Based applications available on 

Google Cloud.

Our customers can analyze, 

govern and visualize data from 

many databases and storage 

systems on Google or other 

Clouds, including all of 

Google's databases, Google 

Sheets, BigQuery, using LOOKER, 

our premier BI and embedded 

analytics solution.

You know, today, we are thrilled

and excited to announce that we 

will be

integrating Tableau, a leader in

data visualization, with Looker,

Google Sheets, and BigQuery.

Tableau customers will soon be 

able to use Looker's semantic 

model, enabling new levels of 

data governance and access to 

data.

Let's take a look.

Aleks, over to you.

In this demo, we're going to 

show you how you can seamlessly 

use Looker and Tableau together 

to answer your critical business

questions.

Let's say I work at an eCommerce

company and our Looker model 

provides a consistent view 

across the organization for our 

most important business metrics.

Here, for example, you can see 

the definition for gross margin.

Our Looker dashboard is based on

that same semantic model.

Since it provides trusted 

insights at a glance, I can 

immediately see that sales are 

up.

However, did I miss anything? 

Let's find out.

Say I'm more comfortable working

in spreadsheets.

I can now take advantage of the 

new integration between Looker 

and Google Sheets.

With a couple of clicks, I have 

access to my governed and 

trusted Looker data in Sheets, 

and I can easily connect to my 

data models.

To understand which factors are 

impacting sales, I'll drag and 

drop fields from my model into a

pivot table to break out sales 

by category over time.

Since it's pulling from Looker, 

I can trust that all the data 

definitions are consistent.

I can use familiar Sheets 

formulas and formatting to get 

insights faster and understand 

how specific products are 

selling.

We see a notable downward trend 

month over month for activewear.

I want to share these findings 

with my marketing team, who's 

using Tableau.

Now I can use the new Tableau 

and Looker integration to 

combine data from my Looker data

model with marketing data to 

build a more comprehensive view 

of my business.

Next, I'm going to plot sales by

category, and then add marketing

spend to the view.

Tableau makes it easy for me to 

drill down on relevant data.

Now I can see that social 

marketing spend was 

significantly lower for 

activewear, and this is why 

there's a downward trend in 

activewear sales.

I'm going to publish this result

on Tableau online and tag my 

marketing team so they can take 

action.

Leveraging integrations between 

Tableau, Sheets, and Looker, 

allows our teams to build 

powerful visualizations using 

trusted data.

We can then share these 

visualizations throughout our 

organization to drive informed 

decisions, action, and impact.

Back over to you, Thomas.

>>THOMAS KURIAN: The second 

question customers ask is, do we

have industry-leading technology

infrastructure? 

We're experiencing great 

momentum with our Open 

Infrastructure Cloud.

Many of the most demanding and 

technically advanced customers 

in the world disproportionately 

choose us.

Take, for example, leading media

companies and streaming 

services, such as

Univision and Globo, the largest

media group in Latin America, 

use our very high performance 

networking, computing and 

storage to broadcast media, 

including live events such as 

the recent Tokyo Olympics.

Leading telecommunications 

companies are also choosing 

Google Cloud.

Reliance Jio, the world's second

largest mobile carrier, is 

automating its 5G network, 

Vodafone is processing over a 

billion network events each day,

AT&T is delivering new 

multi-access edge computing 

solutions, and Telus is 

migrating critical IT and 

network workloads, all to Google

Cloud.

You know, leading data 

management

companies, including Databricks,

Redis, Cockroach DB, Couchbase, 

Elastic, Influx Data, MariaDB, 

MongoDB, Neo4J, and Singlestore 

are all growing faster on Google

Cloud than on any other Cloud 

And they love our storage

scaleability and advanced 

infrastructure.

MongoDB, for instance, has more 

net new customers via Google 

Cloud Marketplace than any other

Cloud.

Leading cybersecurity companies,

such as Palo Alto Networks, 

Exabeam, F5 Shape, Splunk, 

Broadcom, and Forgerock are also

choosing Google Cloud for its 

performance, global scale and 

underlying security.

Customers are migrating and 

transforming SAP and VMware 

workloads to Google Cloud.

In the last year, we've added 

three times the number of SAP 

customers as the prior year, and

we're accelerating.

Paypal, for instance, has an 

SAP/HANA scale out supporting 40

million business transactions 

daily and 200 billion records 

touched in 30 seconds.

Mitel, in Canada, migrated over 

1,00

1,000VM wear virtual machine in 

less than 90 days

to Google Cloud VMware Engine.

Nylas, an API platform company, 

chose our Tau VM's with Google 

Kubernetes Engine, as they saw 

over 40 percent better price 

performance than on a 

competitor.

Customers choose our open Cloud 

infrastructure for three main 

reasons: First, we make your 

path to migrate and modernize 

using the Cloud easy with 

migration tools, new serverless 

and container capabilities, and 

Managed services as your

developers spend more time 

building experiences that your 

customers love.

Second, we offer transformative 

capabilities with cutting edge 

performance and security.

And our network offers three 

times the throughput of other 

Cloud providers.

Third, we remain, and were, the 

very first and only Cloud 

provider with a clear, 

multi-cloud strategy.

We provide you with a consistent

developer experience built on 

open source to write once and 

deploy anywhere.

Many customers like Plaid, a 

financial services leader, use 

Anthos to deploy, operate and 

manage applications across 

multiple clouds.

Recently, we introduced Anthos 

for

virtual machines, standardizing 

the way you manage applications 

Across both virtual machines and

containers.

For multi-cloud data, BigQuery 

Omni lets customers analyze data

across Google Cloud, AWS and 

Azure.

With it, Johnson & Johnson was 

able to combine data in Google 

Cloud and AWS S3 with BigQuery 

Omni without needing to migrate 

data.

Customers also want to expand 

where they use Google Cloud, 

whether in their private data 

Centers or out on the edge.

For instance, some workloads 

cannot move to the public cloud 

entirely due to the need for 

large amounts of local data 

Processing, extremely low 

latency, or strict regulations.

To solve these challenges, we're

Announcing today, Google 

distributed Cloud, a portfolio 

of hardware

and software solutions that 

extend our infrastructure to the

Edge and even into your own data

center.

To tell you more about it, 

please welcome Ines from our 

Google Cloud distrDistributed C 

Team.

>> Thank you, Thomas.

Google Distributed Cloud is a 

set of fully managed services 

running on Google managed 

hardware.

Based on open API's and built on

Anthos, it gives customers 

greater deployment flexibility 

and ensures more consistent 

operations across hybrid and 

multi-cloud environments.

More than any other Cloud 

provider.

There are four deployment 

scenarios depending on your 

specific needs.

Google's Network Edge.

This allows customers to 

leverage over 140 network edge 

locations around the world.

Operator Edge.

This scenario is designed to 

accommodate emergency services 

and applications with a 

stringent latency and 

reliability requirements for a 

specific operator.

Customer edge, this scenario 

supports customer's own edge 

locations such as retail stores,

factory floors or branch 

offices, which require localized

compute and processes.  

And finally, customer data 

centers.

This deployment option is 

specific to customer-owned data 

centers and co-facilities.

Google Distributed Cloud also 

includes a hosted mode to run 

sensitive workloads and address 

data, sovereignty, security and 

privacy requirements.

It does not require connectivity

to Google Cloud at any time to 

manage infrastructure, services,

APIs or tooling.

You have the choice to manage it

yourself, or host through a 

designated trusted partner.

Back to you, Thomas.

>>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, 

Ines.

Partners like HPE, Dell, Cisco 

and NetApp are key as we deploy 

Google Distributed Cloud 

globally on best-of-class 

hardware.

I am pleased to announce the 

expansion of our NetApp 

partnership in two ways.

First, NetApp is our primary 

partner supporting Google's 

Distributed Cloud storage 

infrastructure.

Second, for customers utilizing 

Google Cloud VMware Engine, they

now have preview access for 

NetApp Cloud Volumes.

We are the only hyperscaler to 

provide customers with this 

choice.

Deep partnerships with T-Systems

and Thales have also enabled us 

to address the evolving 

sovereignty requirements for 

Cloud technology in Germany and 

France.

The next question we hear is, 

how can we provide the best 

environment to help employees 

create and innovate together, 

especially in a hybrid 

workplace? 

Hybrid is redefining how we 

All work, making it less about 

where we work, but more about 

the quality of our experience.

Studies estimate that more than 

48 percent of employees will 

work remotely post-COVID.

Google Workspace is the best 

platform for hybrid Work with 

Simple, powerful and secure 

tools to help people

communicate and collaborate with

one another, no matter where 

they are.

We introduced Smart Canvas to 

help content creators remove 

friction from work flows and 

enable teams to stay connected 

outside of meetings to foster 

well-being and reduce video call

fatigue.

We made communication and 

Collaboration completely 

seamless.

For instance, users can easily 

present and

collaborate in meetings, create 

meeting notes from Calendar, 

present in Meet directly from 

Docs, Sheets or Slides, and 

collaborate directly from Chat 

and Spaces.

We optimize collaboration from 

all mobile devices to provide 

great experiences for frontline 

workers, who make up 80 percent 

of the global workforce.

One of America's largest 

hospital systems, Common Spirit 

Health, is advancing its patient

care mission during the pandemic

by making its front line doctors

and nurses productive with 

Google Workspace.

Since hybrid work has removed 

the notion of a physical 

location for work, Google w

Workspace created spaces, a 

unified digital location for 

work.

Today, more than 3 billion users

move securely and seamlessly 

between Mail, Chat, Audio, Video

and now spaces.

And you, too, can choose among 

the over 5,300 public apps in 

our marketplace and you can also

add thousands of private apps to

enhance your work space.

Now, I want to step aside for 

just a minute and tell you about

a hidden secret in our portfolio

products.

Appsheet.

Our local platform that makes it

easy for everyone, not just 

professional developers, to 

build amazing apps and work 

flows.

For instance, property managers 

at car for properties used 

Appsheet to build a mobile app 

to log, track and resolve 

problems with headquarters.

Replacing a multi-step manual 

process.

We're also partnering with 

Citrix, because employees 

sometimes need access to windows

and Mac OS applications and desk

tops, directly served from the 

cloud.

We're expanding our partnership 

with Citrix today to deliver an 

integrated desk top as a service

solution, purpose built on 

Google Cloud.

Customers ask us, do we know 

that our data, systems and users

are secure? 

And how do we keep them secure 

in the future? 

You know, as more digital users 

access more data from more 

locations, the risk of cyber 

security breaches is 

accelerating.

By pioneering new approaches to 

security, Google keeps more 

people safe online than anyone 

else in the world.

Take, for instance, JetBlue.

It's keeping its systems secure,

protecting the data of all its 

travellers, and modernizing its 

security operations use 

Chronicle to detect threats 

across petabytes of security 

telemetry, and eliminating data 

blind spots.

Commerzbank, one of Germany's 

largest banks, is using our new 

Certificate Authority Service to

verify machine and workload 

identity, improving security, 

simplifying operations and 

eliminating entire classes of 

threats.

Secure-by-default drives 

customers to choose Google 

Cloud.

First, we have implemented zero 

trust at the core of our 

services and our operations, 

enabling you to trust nothing.

Second, we have built 

cloud-scale threat detection and

response, allowing you to detect

everything.

And third, we know it's not just

about tools.

We provide the advisor services 

you need to transform security 

operations.

We keep customers safe with 

BeyondCorp Enterprise which 

enables Zero Trust Access for 

all users.

Today, we're expanding Beyond 

Corp to all your applications, 

modern and legacy, Web and desk 

top, and even to production 

environments.

We keep customers safe by 

eliminating software supply 

chain vulnerabilities.

Over the past two decades, we 

pine neared an approach to 

secure our own software supply 

chain.

We are now making that 

technology available through the

salsa open source framework, and

as managed services in our cloud

to help you secure your own 

software supply chain.

We keep customers safe by 

integrating chronicle's threat 

detection capability, with our 

security Command Center, 

allowing you to respond faster 

to potential risks.

And we keep customers safe by 

bringing our security expertise 

to you rs with our Google 

cybersecurity Action Team, a 

team of our leading security 

experts who can help shape your 

security transformation, from 

your very first implementation, 

through responding to a major 

incident, and engineering new 

solutions as needs change.

Finally, we continue to expand 

our secure ecosystem, with 

companies like Fortnet, Palo 

Alto Networks, Thales, and so 

many more.

Today, I would like to welcome a

new security partner, 

cyberreason, with whom we are 

collaborating to deliver a new 

extended Detection and Response 

offering that will combine 

Chronicle's capability with 

Cybereason's Mal/Ops engine for 

faster, easier threat detection 

and response.

Our products, our new 

Cybersecurity Action Team and 

our partnerships all make the 

world safer from cyberthreats.

To talk more about how we help 

keep each and every one of you 

secure, and how we're addressing

some of the most important 

challenges facing our world, I'd

like to invite Sundar back.

Thank you.

>>SUNDAR PICHAI: Thank you, 

Thomas.

Security is top of mind for 

businesses of all sizes, as well

as the public sector.

And despite the progress that 

has been made in cybersecurity, 

large scale breaches continue to

make headlines.

That's why, in August, Google 

announced we will invest $10 

billion over the next five years

to strengthen cybersecurity.

That investment includes 

expanding zero-trust programs, 

helping secure the software 

supply chain, and enhancing 

open-source security.

A new challenge is keeping 

collaboration secure and 

private, as we move to hybrid 

work environments.

To help, we're introducing a new

work Safer Program.

It provides the highest level of

security for your E-mail, 

meetings, messaging and more, 

and brings together Google 

Workspace with Titan Security 

Keys, BeyondCorp, and other 

secure technologies, products 

and partners.

Now every kind of organization 

and business can access the same

security protections that make 

work safer at Google.

Security is an issue that 

affects us all.

And this brings us to the last 

question Thomas posed.

Are we addressing the most 

important challenges facing our 

world? 

Climate change is one of the 

most profound challenges we 

face, and it will take all of us

working together to solve it.

Sustainability has been a core 

value for us for more than two 

decades.

Google has been carbon neutral 

since 2007, and we've matched 

our operations with 100 percent 

renewable energy over four 

consecutive years.

Last year, we set out to make 

our third decade of climate 

action our biggest yet.

That included a bold commitment 

to operate on 24/7 carbon-free 

energy across our offices and 

data centers by 2030.

And last week, we announced new 

ways we're helping one billion 

people make more sustainable 

choices.

When it comes to enterprises, 

one of the most important 

sustainability choices is where 

to run your technology.

IDC predicts Cloud migrations, 

over the next four years, could 

reduce carbon emissions by over 

1 billion metric tons, or the 

equivalent of removing 200 

million cars off the road for a 

year.

We are proud that Google Cloud 

is the cleanest cloud in the 

industry.

Earlier this year, we introduced

a way for customers to choose 

the cleanest regions to run 

their workloads.

Today, we are expanding our

portfolio of solutions and 

partnerships to help reduce your

carbon footprint.

First, we are focused on giving 

you

you greater transparency around 

carbon emissions data.

We're announcing carbon 

footprint, a new service to 

measure, track and report the 

gross carbon emissions 

associated with your Google 

Cloud usage.

Having this data at your 

fingertips is really important.

And we know that many customers 

track sustainability data in 

other places.

That's why I'm happy to announce

that Google Cloud's emission 

data will integrate directly 

into Salesforce's Sustainability

Cloud.

We also want to give you the 

tools to act on that data.

So today, we're introducing a 

new tool that will alert you 

when you have idle workloads and

make recommendations to reduce 

carbon emissions.

It's all part of our goal to 

help make your Cloud 

transformation secure and 

sustainable, and solve for 

what's next.

So on behalf of Thomas and 

myself, let me thank you once 

again for trusting us to be a 

partner with you on this 

journey.

And we hope you enjoy the next 

three days.

Thank you.

>> Hello, and welcome to our 

very first spotlight.

I hope you enjoyed the opening 

keynote.

For the next hour, we will be 

diving in to all things data.

I'm Stephanie Wong, a developer 

advocate, and I'm here with 

Gerrit Kazmaier, who leads 

database, analytics and BI 

solutions at Google Cloud.

>> Thanks, Stephanie.

I am very excited to be here, 

and to share with everyone what 

we have been working on.

The team thought we start on the

light side of things here, and 

start with a joke.

One of my favorite jokes, 

actually.

So here it goes.

A SQL Query walks into a bar and

approaches two tables and asks, 

can I join you? 

[Drum beat].

>> Okay.

I guess we roll the video 

instead.

>> Innovation is a huge 

challenge in baseball.

The current MLB fan expects us 

to be relevant.

>> Customers call us.

Patients call us.

Members call us.

And you can imagine a team 

that's just buried under the 

weight of thousands of call 

recordings.

>> We look at so much data.

Everything you can imagine, we 

analyze.

>> Frankly, we spend 70 percent 

of our time just trying to 

capture it, and trying to sift 

through it.

>> We're expecting to transfer 

or run 300 to 400 petabytes to 

the cloud.

It's hard to even describe how 

big that is.

>> Google Cloud was very 

impressive to us.

It allowed us flexibility in 

storage and compute scaling.

>> Google Cloud provides us with

technology that will drive us to

be better.

>> Now our team can look at 

hundreds of calls a day, in 

minutes instead of weeks.

>> With Google Cloud, we're 

going to be able to spend our 

time analyzing real-time and 

using the data that we've been 

collecting.

>> We thought Google Cloud was 

the best partner for us.

>> I think this is very much 

going to be an open and 

evolving, long-term relationship

between Google and twitter.

>> It's a perfect fit with 

Google Cloud as we go forward.

>> Google's made it possible for

us to reach exceptional customer

experience in a way that hasn't 

been done before.

>> And welcome back.

So what are we solving for 

today? 

This spotlight session is about 

how to leverage data as your 

most strategic business asset, 

especially as you adapt to and 

anticipate change.

Data has the power to transform 

stagnant businesses into 

profitable ones, streamline 

operations to improve people's 

lives, and identify areas of 

waste to radically reduce 

unnecessary spending.

It can be used to solve 

businesses and world problems, 

both the simple ones and the 

ones that keep people up at 

night.

It has the potential to 

accelerate progress faster than 

a think tank or world summit.

And it's largely untapped.

As you learn more about Google 

Cloud capabilities and make 

progress on your data Cloud 

journey, you can unlock your own

10X mindset as external factors 

accelerate the pace of change.

Never before have we faced this 

much uncertainty, and now is the

time when every company can turn

data into an ability.

The reality today is that too 

many companies struggle to 

remove the barriers to turn data

into intelligence.

>> This is exactly what we are 

seeing with our customers, 

turning data into intelligence 

and delivering value is no 

longer a nice to have.

It is essential.

A recent study shows that only 

32 percent of the companies 

surveyed gain value from their 

data investments, and this is 

the result of 

difficult-to-access, slow, 

unreliable, complex and 

fragmented systems.

Many companies just feel 

overwhelmed with the demand for 

the various types of working 

with data, and of doing it at 

scale.

They feel walled in with a lack 

of integration, a lack of 

openness, a lack of portability,

and very poor APIs.

It is time to re-imagine our 

data cloud strategy that is 

unlocking your data advantage.

Build great applications that 

understand and interact with 

your customer, and operational 

databases that scale to billions

of queries per second, react on 

any event in real times and 

process millions of data 

streams, analyze petabytes of 

data without sizing or tuning 

your data warehouse anymore, and

ultimately, optimize your 

processes with hundreds of 

machine learning models in 

production.

This is how you unlock your data

cloud and unlock your data 

advantage.

To build your data cloud, you 

need your systems to be simple.

And this requires a partner that

meets you where you are today, 

and helps you to mature where 

you want to be, but at your own 

pace.

Making the complex simple is our

business.

It has been for decades, 

building systems that mask the 

complexity of the entire 

internet behind a simple, single

interface, and building 

applications with billions of 

users.

It all runs on data and 

analytics.

So you can say that data is our 

DNA, and we can't predict the 

future, but we can plan for it.

And we are deeply grateful to 

work with tens of thousands of 

organizations who built their 

data clouds on Google Cloud and 

unlocked ultimately their data 

advantage from databases to 

analytics to streams to lakes to

AI, and built a unified data 

cloud together with us.

>> It's leaders like you who are

accelerating their use of data 

to transform complexity into 

simplicity.

This week at Next, you'll hear 

from leading organizations that 

have chosen Google Cloud for 

their data Cloud strategy over 

market alternatives.

Verizon Media is one of these 

customers.

Verizon uses BigQuery and Lookie

to scale their massive 

enterprise media warehouse, 

supporting monthly scans with 

more than one exabyte of data.

The performance improvements 

include 90 percent plus 

productivity improvements across

the board, and lower overall TCO

compared to other Cloud 

providers.

Almost overnight, traffic to 

Chess.com tripled.

The pandemic and successful 

series, "The Queen's Gambit" 

created a perfect storm.

Ten years worth of growth 

occurred in just six months, and

daily active users rose from 

280,000 to more than one 

million.

There's no way to handle that 

surge without the move to Google

Cloud.

Using BigQuery's near infinite 

ability to scale in response to 

demand, this meant that 

Chess.com didn't have to 

forecast site traffic and worry 

about unexpected surges or waste

money by over-provisioning 

servers that go unused.

>> Take Auto Trader.

It's U.K.'s largest online 

automotive marketplace and they 

were able to migrate more than 

60 percent of their current 

Oracle footprint to Cloud SQL.

Auto trader builds their data 

cloud by leveraging Cloud SQL, 

BigQuery and Looker to deliver

access to their data to all of 

their users, and with Cloud SQL 

as a fully managed service, Auto

Trader release cadence has 

improved by over 140 percent 

year over year, enabling an 

impressive peak of more than 450

releases to production on a 

single day.

And this is how you build your 

data advantage.

>> When Cardinal Health migrated

to Google Cloud, they enabled 

disaster recovery, increased 

their ability to respond to 

business challenges, and 

leveraged machine learning to 

drive business efficiencies, all

while reducing their cost by 25 

percent.

We would like to welcome Ray 

Bajaj CTO of Cardinal Health to 

share their data transformation 

story.

Ray, thank you so much for 

joining us here today.

>> Thanks, Stephanie.

And I'm really happy to be here 

today.

Cardinal Health is a pioneer in 

healthcare industry for 

leveraging the Cloud as our 

primary source of 

infrastructure, achieving our 

Cloud transformation journey 

with more than 80 percent of our

workload fully migrated on to 

the Cloud.

Our journey to Google Cloud 

started in 2018, leveraging the 

security and flexibility of 

Google Cloud allows us to scale 

and innovate at lower cost, 

which empowers the organization 

to focus on building the future 

of healthcare and driving better

outcomes across the healthcare 

ecosystem.

>> So why Google Cloud? 

>> With Google, we can deliver 

modern data insights 

Capabilities to our engineering 

teams so that they can transform

our

whole business, while also 

improving the customer 

experience, helping the 

organization evolve in adjacent 

areas of healthcare.

We also selected Google Cloud 

because of its ability to 

partner with SAP and run massive

ERP workloads reliably.

>> Now, what outcomes have you 

been able to realize as a result

of this? 

>> We leverage Google's Looker 

and BigQuery to develop episode 

analytics, a data-driven, 

predicted cost-tracking tool 

that enables community and 

quality practices to accurately 

measure the cost of care and 

provides clearer insights in to 

value-based performance.

>> Well, ray, Cardinal is 

clearly at the forefront of 

these shifts, and we can't wait 

to see what's in store for you.

So thank you so much for being 

here with us today.

>> Thank you.

>> Organizations like Cardinal 

Health are solving complex 

challenges with Google Cloud.

But what is holding others back 

from using data to accelerate 

innovation? 

Companies are looking for 

solutions that can simplify 

their data landscape to move 

from a state where every 

scenario requires a new tool to 

an agile platform that combines 

data analytics, databases, data 

engineering and science, 

security and governance into a 

single platform.

To move from data at rest to a 

platform where data is 

accessible in real-time.

>> Our vision is to provide a 

platform that allows data to 

unfold its full potential.

Ultimately, enabling us to reach

new horizons ranging from newly 

built digital experiences, 

products and business models to 

advanced machine learning and 

AI, to ultimately empowering 

humans to reason beyond their 

own biological capacity.

And we have built the industry's

most simple, intelligent and 

best integrated cloud data 

platform that enables businesses

to fuel their own digital 

transformation.

And this is how you unlock your 

data advantage, to seize new 

opportunities, improve 

operational efficiencies and 

deliver new use experiences that

delight customers, partners and 

your employees.

Thanks to you, our customers and

partners, Google's data platform

is one of the fastest growing 

clouds fueled by the demand for 

products like BigQuery.

And here comes the most exciting

part.

Today, we are excited to 

announce a number of new product

innovations.

And the first announcement goes 

out to all of the data engineers

in the world who are using Spark

on Google Cloud.

Open standards are at the heart 

of our Data Cloud strategy, and 

at Google, we follow an open 

approach that enables 

flexibility and choice.

And today, I'm excited to 

announce Project Big Spark.

It is the world's first 

autoscaling serverless Spark 

service in existence.

And regardless of whether you 

are a BigQuery user, a data user

or a cloud AI user, we have 

created an integrated ecosystem 

around spark that the factor 

standard for data engineering 

workloads.

We want to make it easy for you 

to onboard on our platform of 

Spark and never limit your 

ambition with data science and 

data engineering.

>> Our long history in the open 

source community has shown us 

that betting on the community 

first is always the right 

strategy to give our customers 

portability and optionality.

We're excited to make Spark a 

first-class citizen on our 

platform, and to automate the 

productionalization of our data 

engineering and data science 

workloads.

>> The next announcement goes to

all of the data scientists.

As enterprises consolidate their

data platforms, the distinction 

between advanced analytics and 

data science and machine 

learning is really diminishing.

Today, more than ever, data 

scientists are looking for 

unified interface to be able to 

seamlessly connect their entire 

data estate, and also run all 

explorations with SQL, Spark and

auto machine learning libraries.

With Vertex AI, we have 

simplified the experience for 

data scientists with 80 percent 

less code required to train a 

model compared to any other 

platform.

As a product of Google's Vertex 

AI's credit sheet, I am happy to

announce the preview of AI 

Notebook for Vertex AI, that 

offers a fully managed, scalable

and enterprise-grade IDE 

combined with easily enforceable

policies and user management.

>> These AI Notebook innovations

are great examples of Google 

bringing together the power of 

data and AI.

Google truly aims to fast-track 

innovation by eliminating the 

need for data scientists to 

shift context between aspects 

like data analytics, data 

science and machine learning.

>> That is right on.

And here is an exciting 

announcement to all of the 

developers.

We are adding a Postgres 

interface for Spanner, which 

continues our commitment to 

openness and reinforces our 

efforts to democratize the 

access to Spanner.

With this new Postgres 

interface, enterprises can take 

advantage of Spanner's unmatched

global scale, five 9's of 

availability, and strong 

consistency, using skills and 

tools from the popular Postgres 

ecosystem, and starting today, 

you can create a Spanner 

database that uses Postgres SQL 

dialect and connect with its 

open wire protocol.

This interface supports 

Spanner's rich feature set, 

using the most popular Postgres 

data types and SQL features, and

thus, democratizing access to 

Spanner for millions of 

developers out there.

Our commitment to the ecosystem 

has been longstanding, with 

ongoing support for Cloud SQL, 

for my SQL, Postgres, and SQL 

Server, so you can lift and 

shift your databases.

Our mission with Cloud SQL is 

compatibility, and we were the 

first cloud provider to support 

Postgres 13.

>> These announcements are so 

exciting, because Postgres has 

emerged as a popular choice for 

operational databases.

Postgres is known and loved for 

its stability and feature set 

and has built an active and 

growing ecosystem of developers 

and tools.

Our investments in Postgres are 

a step in the right direction to

continue meeting developers 

where they are, with the tools 

they love.

>> We are excited to announce 

new ways to help organizations 

going beyond traditional 

business intelligence to 

analyze, access and act on data.

Looker continues to integrate 

with the other offerings in our 

portfolio, as well as continues 

to innovate with our core 

product.

And to address the needs, we are

continuing to simplify the 

experience across BigQuery, 

Looker and Data Studio, together

with Connected Sheets.

Today, we are announcing new 

enhancements which bring the 

reality of augmented analytics 

to more people with Looker 

solution for Contact Center AI 

to help businesses leverage AI 

and converse naturally with 

customers and deliver 

outstanding experiences.

We are also announcing a new 

Looker block for healthcare NLP 

AI, which creates a user 

interface to advance AI and 

natural language functionality, 

and this helps healthcare 

providers to gain deeper 

understandings of their patient 

data.

>> Part of the secret sauce lies

in Looker's in database 

architecture and semantic layer 

which makes it possible for 

business users to trust data, no

matter how they experience it, 

via a dashboard, E-mail or text 

alert, or even a custom 

application.

We are excited for these recent 

innovations, but we couldn't do 

this alone.

Together with our community of 

customers, partners and 

developers, we are delivering 

innovation across a variety of 

use cases.

We are able to create new 

solutions and accelerate your 

journey to transform data in to 

value.

>> Next, I want to announce an 

important partnership with 

Informatica.

We have partnered with 

Informatica to help hundreds of 

customers succeed with their 

journey to the cloud.

Together, we are helping 

customers move mission critical 

workloads to the cloud and 

integrate with Google Cloud 

technologies, such as BigQuery.

Today, we are excited to 

announce that we are deepening 

our partnership with Informatica

even more.

First, for existing Informatica 

power center customers, we are 

so pleased to announce our 

migration factory, which will 

help to accelerate migration of 

data-driven workloads to Google 

Cloud with Informatica Cloud.

Second, we are pleased to 

announce our new services or 

Google Cloud's Marketplace, 

which will include Informatica's

integration and enterprise data 

catalog offerings.

And we are continuing to invest 

in key product integrations with

databricks.

Our engineering and product 

teams continue to work together 

to deliver the joint road map, 

and we have multiple customers 

using our latest enterprise 

security and performance 

enhancements of databricks on 

GKE.

In Q4, we will also deliver 

databricks SQL, databricks  

photon on Google Cloud, as well 

as we are launching new data 

center regions together in EMEA 

and APEC.

Our AI teams are engaged to 

allow customers to experiment 

and develop models on databricks

and Vertex AI together and 

deploy models at scale in to 

production with Vertex ML Ops 

suite.

>> So much goodness.

Okay.

Before we get into the live 

demo, I recommend tuning in to 

more sessions to hear from all 

our customers this week.

Join the chief data officer 

panel discussion, and listen to 

our product strategy sessions 

for database, data analytics, BI

and AI.

>> We can't wait to hear from 

you.

Connect with you.

Join us in our community and 

share your expertise and ask 

your questions.

But most importantly, start to 

build your data cloud and unlock

your data advantage.

Okay.

Time now to get hands-on and 

check out our products in real 

action.

Join us for live demo and 

interact with our experts and 

one another, and then stick 

around for the live Q&A 

following the demo.

I'll see you there.

>> Hi, everybody.

I'm Leah.

>> And I'm Nikita.

>> And welcome to the Data Cloud

live demo.

If you're just joining us from 

this morning's keynote and 

spotlight, you heard from the 

latest innovations we launched.

Earth Engine, Spark on Google 

Cloud, Postgres secret interface

for spanner, and workbench all 

to help organizations -- and 

simplify them.

Bringing together data on a 

massive scale to explore a 

real-world scenario for climate 

and supply chain analytics.

>> In order to do this, we're 

going to need the whole data 

team.

Say hi, everybody.

>> Hello.

I'm Brad.

>> Hi.

I'm Derrick.

>> Now, a quick reminder.

This demo is truly live and you 

can engage with us directly.

So ask questions, say hi in the 

chat window, and hit those 

emojis.

>> I think I see some coming in 

now.

I see lots of hearts and fire.

A lot of people saying hello in 

the chat.

Thanks, everyone, for joining us

today.

So if you can't see this or the 

chat, just go back to the Next 

Event Web site and click on the 

blue join the Join the Interact 

Experience button.

>> Okay.

>> Okay.

You're actually joining us for 

our weekly stand-up at symbol 

super store, a fictional 

U.S.-based grocery chain focused

on sourcing from local 

producers.

Like many different industries, 

we need to bring together 

disparate data sources to build 

resilience, specifically for us,

drought in the western U.S. has 

impacted our producers, and our 

supply chain has been disrupted 

with decreased shipments week 

over week.

>> We need to better understand 

how to manage inventory, and to 

prevent stock-outs, and ensure 

we can scale in both how we 

analyze information and how we 

run our transactions.

>> All right, team.

So to address this supply and 

scale changes that Nikita just 

mentioned, we have four 

different workloads.

First, I'm going to evaluate the

best climate information to 

identify at-risk producers.

Then, Brad will mature our data 

pipelines to transform that 

data.

Ne, Derrick will dig in to 

scaling our transaction 

processing.

And finally, Nikita will show 

how we're gaining new insights 

by evolving our data science 

capabilities.

>> Let's get into it and let's 

keep hearing from all of you out

there, our data pros.

Leah, you're up first.

>> Great! 

Thanks, Nakita.

So in order to gain insight into

our supply chain, first I need 

to evaluate the risks.

So I'm focusing on figuring out 

how drought impacts the very 

source of our grocery products.

And to do this, I turn to 

Google's platform for earth 

science data and analytics, 

Earth Engine, which has a huge 

catalog of satellite images for 

things like climate, weather, 

crop lands and much more.

There's currently over, like, 50

petabytes of data in the 

catalog.

Plus, more and more images are 

added each day.

So let me just go ahead and 

bring up this cool little 

application that I built using 

the Earth Engine Code Editor.

So I can walk you through the 

three data sets we'll be using 

today.

First is going to be crop data 

from the USDA NASS Program, 

which I can grab right from the 

public data catalog by 

searching.

This data set is going to 

contain one image of the U.S. 

going back all the way to 1997.

And each ten-meter pixel in this

image has actually been assigned

a crop type.

Let me just close -- the second 

data set contains the outline of

agricultural fields.

And we're going to use earth 

engine to assign each one of 

these fields the crop type that 

is most prevalent among the 

sales that cover it.

So in this view that I'm showing

right here, the pink fields are 

alfalfa, and the dark green 

fields almonds.

>> Leah, these fields are super 

helpful, but can we export this 

data for analysis in other 

environments? 

>> Yep.

I'm actually going to push this 

in to cloud storage and BigQuery

in just a second, but first I 

want to add in some additional 

signals on drought.

So the third data set that I'm 

using is a collection of both 

short and long-term kraut  

drought indicators, meaning that

we can see what drought looks 

like for each field.

Now, using data sets like these 

does require some deep subject 

matter expertise.

So special thanks to our 

real-world partners at Climate 

Engine who build solutions on 

top of eaEarth Engine's API, 

helping organizations ground 

their analytics projects with 

scientifically accepted 

methodologies.

Okay.

So you just saw how we used 

geospatial data, and I want to 

know how you use it in your 

analysis.

So go ahead and answer that poll

so we can see.

All right, everyone.

So with these layers in place, 

we can start exploring drought 

risk.

Let me just go ahead and zoom to

this field.

And here, I'm going to show an 

almond orchard northeast of 

Modesto, California.

And overlooking that is the 

long-term drought indicator.

So this orange tint that you're 

seeing means that this field has

experienced pretty high levels 

of drought over the last five 

years.

Now, if I go ahead and just zoom

out a bit, we can actually see 

that the entire central valley 

in California is pretty drought 

stressed.

So my last step was to calculate

drought risk for each of the 

fields I showed before.

And this will tell us which 

farms and produce types are 

potentially at risk for not 

meeting customer demand, which 

is just one consideration to 

inform symbols resilient 

strategy.

Better yet, we can incorporate 

the geography data with other 

spatial stuff like store and 

customer locations that are 

already inside of BigQuery.

And anyone who knows me knows 

that I love BigQuery.

If you agree, let me see in the 

emojis.

All right.

So the code editor has been 

great for interacting with Earth

Engine, but making these 

calculations at scale requires a

different approach.

So I went ahead and created 

earth engine tasks for batch 

processing to run these 

calculations over all the data 

in five-day increments for this 

ten years.

I also set up a cloud function 

to run every five days going 

forward so that we'll always 

have fresh data.

Now, just as a quick recap, we 

jumped into earth engine to 

evaluate earth science data that

indicates climate risk for our 

farm fields.

Now we'll have fresh drought 

data available in Cloud storage.

So just think of the power of 

integrating huge amounts of 

specialized data, giving us a 

complete picture of supply risk 

for our business.

Oh, and I think I can see the 

poll results coming in now.

It looks like lots of people are

using geospatial data for all 

different kinds of things, and 

if your answer wasn't in the 

poll, just go ahead and let us 

know in the chat.

So next up, Brad will transform 

and push this data into BigQuery

so geospatial analysis with our 

existing data.

So Brad, over to you.

>> Okay.

That was pretty cool, Leah.

Thanks.

All right.

So to gain more insight in to 

how drought is impacting 

production, my main focus has 

been building out the data 

transformation pipeline to push 

farm field drought indicators 

from cloud storage into 

BigQuery.

Speaking of batch processing, as

you know, to assist with 

inventory management, price 

optimization and product 

assortment, we use product to --

we use Google Cloud data as our 

long-running clusters.

For you data pros out there, we 

would love to know how you're 

using Spark today so let us know

while I go ahead and pull up the

cloud Console.

So here is a data cles sicluste 

we currently use.

This code is typical boiler 

plate code for basic data 

transformations.

In this case, we are processing 

the earth engine files from 

cloud storage, performing type 

checking and mapping to ensure 

proper ingestion in to BigQuery 

using the Spark Bill Clinton 

query 

BigQuery connector.

>> So this is pretty cool, but I

think having a batch work flow 

that's scheduled on a 

continuously running cluster 

seems like it can be wasteful.

So is there any way we can make 

this more efficient? 

>> That's a fair point, Leah.

There is still some overhead in 

management here, and for 

hardened batch cases like this, 

it would be preferred to have 

these jobs run on their own 

discrete resources.

Good news, with the new 

serverless option, we can submit

a price job without submitting 

any infrastructure.

These automatic capabilities,ic 

spend more Dev time writing code

and less time on writing 

infrastructure.

>> All right, Brad.

First off, I'm pretty sure that 

you just set me up for that, and

secondly, you definitely made up

that word, auto-magic.

>> Yeah, can I get some emoji 

love for that? 

Anyway, I'll now go ahead and 

export this notebook to a Python

file, nuings  using NNB convert.

Okay.

And next, let's go and use the 

cloud SDK.

We can use the data Proc API and

call batches to submit a 

serverless job.

So I'm showing you here a price 

park job, but I can also submit 

jobs in scholar or SQL.

With auto provision and auto 

scale, no infrastructure 

configuration is needed.

This helps -- powerful 

distributed data processing 

model.

With these capabilities, there's

no need to manually create into 

clusters.

So once I've submitted the 

So clearly it's been a busy week

for me, using Spark serverless 

to create pipelines to push 

drought data in to BigQuery, but

the efficiency equivalents we'll

gain by not needing to manage 

cluster overhead will be worth 

it.

Now, you can let me know in the 

chat if you're as excited as I 

am.

>> Okay.

Let's see how everyone's using 

Spark today.

Looks like notebooks are pretty 

popular.

Oh, and automation through air 

flow.

That's cool, too.

Okay.

Great.

Thanks so much, Brad.

So now that we have greater 

insight in to supply risks, we 

need to scale our transaction 

systems to handle more orders 

and allow us to understand the 

potential business impact of 

these climate risks.

Hop

Hopefully while lowering costs.

So this brings me to Derrick, 

our DBA.

Derrick, you've been focusing on

this effort, so can you let us 

know where you're at today? 

>> Yeah.

Absolutely, Leah.

We have a new grocery chain that

has struggled to maintain their 

on prem databases as they've 

grown.

There's an opportunity to solve 

their underlying scaling 

problems with cloud spanner.

I spent the last few weeks 

evaluating spanner's ability to 

scale and the ease of 

maintenance while keeping strong

consistency for this point of 

sale workload.

I migrated some of the chains to

spanner already.

Using granular instant sizing, I

only provisioned a portion of a 

spanner node to handle the 

required load.

As we move the remainder of 

stores, we can easily scale up 

without down time or app 

changes.

>> Quick question, Derrick.

We've been really focused on 

reducing the cost and complexity

of building scalable 

applications, so I'm wondering 

how does adding spanner impact 

that effort? 

>> Yeah, that's a great 

question.

One way we've been doing this 

inometer environments is to 

standardize on postgres, a 

well-established open database 

that our development and ops 

teams are already familiar with.

I tried to get the team to add 

an elephant emoji so you all 

could show some love for 

Postgres, but anyway.

Spanner just announced a 

Postgres interface.

This gives us the benefits of 

spanner without having to 

complete retrain our application

teams.

Having -- this data will help us

maintain velocity for new 

features, even as our database 

needs evolve.

Here.

Let me show you.

So I've connected in to our 

spanner, using the SQL command 

line tool.

From here, I can explore the 

schema, just like I would any 

other database, any other 

Postgres database.

You can see that both the 

Postgres data type and the 

spanner data type is available 

to the information schema.

So this will make it familiar to

anyone who already knows 

Postgres.

>> Awesome.

Thanks, Derrick.

This is really great.

>> Absolutely.

And I highlighted how spanner 

allows us to get started small 

and scale as needed using 

granular instant sizing, and how

the new Postgres will interface 

reduces friction for our teams 

already familiar with Postgres.

You can use existing data, and 

I'll keep onboarding more 

stores.

Nakita, I believe you need this 

data for some of the BigQuery 

analysis you were working on.

You've been busy figuring out 

how to evolve our ability to 

make sense of all this data.

Can you show us how that works? 

>> Yes.

Absolutely.

I was hoping that you'd ask.

So to ensure that we're managing

stock to meet customer demand, 

my focus this week was on 

evolving our data science for 

exploratory analysis.

I combined the transactional 

data that Derrick's been working

on with the jot data that Leah 

and Brad pushed in to BigQuery.

This way, we can gain insight in

to which products are most at 

risk of not meeting customer 

demand.

So my first step was to 

integrate all of our 

transactional data within 

BigQuery, primarily using 

Federation with Cloud SQL and 

Spanner.

This provided a unified 

environment for aggregation and 

analysis, where we can join 

transactions back to producer 

details and the associated 

drought risk scores.

Now, as you all know, we 

recently migrated To Workbench, 

which has really, really helped 

with our basic compute and 

resource management.

>> Quick question, Nakita.

Is Vertex AI workbench -- 

>> That is an excellent 

question, Derrick.

Vertex AI workbench contains 

recently updated managed 

notebooks to bring forth more 

integrated data capabilities 

into our data science 

environments.

So we can ingest and analyze 

data and deploy and manage ML 

models all from one spot.

Now, let me show you a little 

bit about what this -- after I 

provisiond the new managed 

notebook, my first task was to 

analyze the demand on the 

high-volume excuse, and with 

that I used the BigQuery 

connected to view the sales 

data.

With Vertex AI workbench, I can 

inspect BigQuery metadata, 

preview tables, and automate 

entirely from my notebook 

environment.

Okay.

It's my turn on the emojis.

I want to see the fire emoji for

people who are as excited as I 

am about being able to access 

BigQuery from the notebook 

interface.

I'm not the only one.

>> Hey, Nakita, hold on.

Sorry to interrupt your emoji 

fest, but I see you're working 

out of the lakes project but are

able to pin other projects that 

you have access to, like the ops

project.

Is that new? 

>> Yes.

That's correct, Brad.

Vertex AI workbench also enables

me to interact with all services

via my own identity.

It also provides code to help 

build out queries and project 

results.

So here, we can see -- oh, looks

like I just need to refresh.

Sorry about this.

Just going to refresh my Jupiter

lab instance here.

I guess I had it open for too 

long.

>> And I guess while Nakita is 

doing that, like who uses 

Jupiter now? 

Let's see the fire emojis 

lighting up.

I personally use it a lot in my 

day-to-day.

>> All right.

Thank you.

So perfect.

You can see a simple view of all

transactions by the day of week.

And Vertex workbench also allows

me to launch different kernels 

entirely in the same instance.

So Brad, I think you were 

working out of a notebook 

earlier, is that correct? 

>> Yeah.

So the data -- the back end as a

part of spark on Google Cloud.

We can access all supported 

kernels on the cluster, 

including High Spark.

>> Well, from my analysis, I 

just needed a python kernel.

So let me show you what's going 

on in this notebook and what 

I've been up to this week.

You can see I did a deep dive 

into the data.

I've created a heat of purchase 

accounts across various 

departments -- the short-term 

drought index across various 

crop types, like corn, dry 

beans, pears and rice.

My last task, and the most 

important task, was to map skews

to suppliers and calculate a 

risk score based on the 

aggregate field data.

So to do this I started with our

mapping table, which you can see

a sample of right here.

This helped me to determine -- I

calculated a weighted risk score

that takes into account each 

product's demand and the 

associated farms' overall 

drought risk and you can see 

each of these measurements in 

this data frame right here.

Ultimately, this goal will help 

us to prioritize managing items 

where we're most at risk of not 

meeting customer demand.

So as a quick summary, I use -- 

to connect -- and create a 

weighted risk score for each one

of our products, combining both 

climate and demand data.

Leah, I went ahead and put all 

of this back in to BigQuery just

to keep it centralized.

>> Awesome.

Thanks so much, Nakita.

That risk score is going to be 

huge in helping our team 

understand supply risk.

So to make sure the team has a 

trusted view of all this 

information, I started 

incorporating everything into a 

worker dashboard.

Now, with Looker, we define our 

metrics like average risk, using

work ML looker's data model, and

Looker uses this to compile SQL 

queries and send them back.

So that our users can explore 

the results of these efforts.

So let me show you this 

dashboard that I've been working

on.

And first off, you can see this 

custom map layer that I use to 

visualize drought risk across 

farm regions in the west, and 

we're able to take -- geospatial

functions and drill from this 

aggregate view all the way to 

producer or even grocery prepped

level.

Let me show you.

So I'll drill to fields ID and 

then I can jump right in to look

er's explore.

Maybe I want to specifically 

look at products that are at 

risk in this region where we're 

quickly expanding.

Making all this data accessible 

to the broader team is really 

important, so can we make sure 

that the team is aware of this 

so that they know how to hold 

off on coupons or advertisements

for these products? 

>> Yeah.

Actually, we can set up a 

schedule from Looker so that the

regional marketing teams are 

always notified if new products 

seem to go at risk.

So putting this all together, we

used Earth Engine to process new

earth science data signals.

We used -- to efficiently 

transform geospatial data and 

push drought indicators in to 

BigQuery, Spanner to scale our 

transaction systems, enduring we

have the infrastructure to 

handle future growth, and Vertex

AI Workbench plus Looker backed 

by the power of BigQuery to 

evolve our data science 

capabilities, and serve 

important trends back to key 

decision makers.

Across these services, anyone is

able to explore and take action 

on insights that combine climate

data and transactions.

Now, we can understand where 

products may go out of stock due

to increasing drought 

conditions, and identify areas 

to build resilience against 

changes in our climate.

So with this geospatial 

information, we're given a whole

new set of data so that we can 

not only be considerate of our 

customers, but also find ways to

be more considerate of our 

planet.

And with that, it looks like 

we're right about at time.

So thank you so much for joining

us today, as we've shown how 

Google Cloud can offer a world 

class experience for creating a 

scalable, unifightified 

platform.

And a special thanks to my 

colleagues, Nakita, Derrick, for

introducing us to Spanner and 

it's Postgres interoperability 

and Brad, for walking us through

Spark on Google Cloud.

>> And thank you, Leah, for 

showing us Looker and Earth 

Engine.

Last, but certainly not least, 

thank you all out there so much 

for your engagement.

We love those emojis and seeing 

all of your comments in the 

chat.

So stay tuned for our live Q&A, 

which is going to cover 

everything from our spotlight 

through this demo.

>> Thank you! 

Bye! 

>> Thanks, everyone! 

>> Thanks, bye! 

>> Thanks, data cloud team.

What a cool demo! 

I'm Dane Hanson.

Welcome, everyone.

I'm the director of product 

marketing for data cloud.

Joining me today is Garrett.

>> Hey, Dane.

I'm Garrett.

I'm the vice president of data 

analytics, data basis and 

Looker, and I do look forward to

everyone's questions.

>> I do, too.

A reminder that this Q&A is 

live.

You can engage with us directly.

So ask your questions, say hi in

the chat, hit those emojis, and 

if you can't, just go -- 

experience button.

>> So let us jump right in.

But before we do, I do like to 

see what you like most today, so

we have quite an exciting set of

announcement, and is it for you,

let's go bigger query, Postgres 

for all, or is it show me the 

earth engine.

>> So while we wait for those 

results, tell ple, what are you 

most excited about? 

>> Two things, openness and 

simplicity.

All of our announcements were 

made to make data more 

accessible, more simple to use, 

from Postgres for Spanner, from 

cross cloud analytics from Omni,

everything is in the spirit of 

making data simple to work with 

and creating an open ecosystem 

around GCP for working with 

data.

>> That's right.

And being open and simple is 

really what it's all about, and 

it's what we saw from the demo 

as well.

Just a reminder that our friends

from the live demo are sticking 

around to help answer the 

questions.

So you might see their faces 

throughout the show.

It looks like we've got some of 

the poll results.

It's all about BigQuery.

Look at those hearts come in.

So this is really good.

>> Bigger query.

>> All right.

So let's get into our first 

question.

It's from Tianna.

She asks about the availability 

of earth engine.

We saw the great demo earlier 

from the team.

How can folks get their hands on

this? 

How can they access it and 

another follow-up question which

is how does it work with 

BigQuery GIS.

>> Awesome.

Hey, Tianna, awesome question.

So first of all, Google Earth 

Engine is now in preview, which 

means that you can go to 

Google.com/earth engine preview 

and register, and we will be 

reaching out to you to set you 

up with an account.

the second key piece of what we 

have seen earlier is that in 

earth engine, you have a data 

lake of satellite imagery, and 

you get a means to do geospatial

analysis on imagery data, and 

the results can be brought into 

BigQuery to match them up with 

all of the data you have 

residing there, or using 

BigQuery, for instance, as we 

have seen.

so all in all, awesome package, 

a lot of data and data 

integration right back in to 

BigQuery.

>> I love this, and it's what we

can provide with the best of 

earth data and the best of 

analytic solution.

this is a great solution.

>> that's exactly right.

>> so another question comes in 

from Chris.

This is exciting.

What is Google's plans around 

data management? 

Does it have plans, Garrett  

Gerrit, to expand our 

multi-cloud approach to other 

data management services? 

>> Great question, Chris, and I 

think it all starts from 

recognizing basic fact.

For the majority of companies, 

multi-cloud is a reality, and 

when we talk about data silos, 

we have to recognize that a 

modern data silo and a 

multi-cloud data silo, and at 

big query omni, we wanted to 

bring simplicity to multicloud, 

which means that you can do 

cross-cloud analytics, and we 

are constantly evaluating which 

of our data services makes sense

in an omni delivery, and 

basically following our customer

scenarios where you are taking 

us, too, and you can expect much

more to come in that direction.

>> This is great.

Really go forward with 

multi-cloud as more and more 

companies are using that as 

their norm.

>> I think it's 90 percent of 

the companies that we've 

surveyed actually say that 

multi-cloud for them is the 

reality they are living in 

today.

So let's place to that 

complexity and deliver 

multi-cloud across core 

analytics.

>> Okay.

Good.

Good.

Thank you, Gerrit.

Next question comes in from Anon

at CVS health.

He asks this question to Leah, 

actually.

Is there any map that reveals 

all the services? 

I think you might have shown 

this at the tail end of the 

demo, but maybe you could go 

back and do sort of an overview 

about the visualizations, the 

capabilities of looker, how does

Looker and BigQuery play a role 

with the visualizations for that

map of Earth Engine? 

>> Awesome.

Yeah.

Thanks, Dane.

So basically, I think what this 

question is asking is if you can

visualize the actual Samanthaic 

mo

is he mantic moindel that you'r 

creating in Looker, and actually

earlier this year, looker 

launched the diagram which is 

available in Looker's 

marketplace, so you can directly

create a visualization of your 

data model, whether your data is

in BigQuery, Spanner or other 

places that are connected to 

Looker, so check it out.

>> That's awesome.

Thank you, Leah.

The next question comes in 

around our Cloud SQL and Cloud 

spanner capabilities.

We offer both capabilities 

today, as you know, Gerrit.

Which one is for which purpose? 

Could you talk a little bit 

about how spaSpanner is our -- t

is your recommendation? 

What use cases to use Cloud SQL,

as well as Cloud Spanner? 

>> That is a great question, 

because both of them, actually, 

are pretty awesome services.

Cloud SQL is really a managed 

service where you can decide 

whether you want Postgres or my 

SQL, and it's really for those 

customers who want to leverage 

basically perfect compatibility 

with the my SQL ecosystem, use 

all of the packages, use 

everything around that type of 

system.

And it's a really highly 

reliable, high performance 

managed service that we are 

providing.

Spanner sits on the other end of

the spectrum, if you like.

Like it's a cloud native 

database, it combines a unique 

set of abilities.

It has five 9's of availability.

That is unheard of.

It has global consistency.

It's horizontally scaling.

All of the things that you want 

to use when you're building 

massively scaling global 

applications.

And so if you are looking on 

that spectrum, that's really 

about scale, and yet, having 

strong consistency, then Spanner

is the way to go.

And the good news is from 

today's announcement, you can 

use Spanner with a Postgres 

interface, which means that you 

don't need to relearn or take 

another tool set chain in order 

to work with it.

You can basically seamlessly 

apply your Postgres skills and 

go Cloud Native with Google 

Cloud Spanner.

>> That's awesome.

Let me ask another question.

It's about a relour recent 

partnership with Tableau.

This is a pretty exciting 

partnership.

We've done a lot with them.

And could you talk a little bit 

about how this strategy in this 

partnership helps our Looker 

customers specifically? 

>> It is really about simplicity

and openness.

This announcement means that if 

you are a Tableau customer, you 

will be able to use looker's 

semantic models and Looker for 

tr

trusted governance, for high 

performance database access.

If you are a Looker customer, it

means that you can add Tableau's

self service data visualization 

right on to your Looker 

scenario.

So the bottom line is that it 

makes working with data more 

simple.

It helps our customers who are 

trying to find the right balance

between self service and 

flexibility and strong 

governance and semantics.

It really brings together the 

best out of two worlds.

>> That's great.

And I think it's really a 

reflection of our open strategy 

for the data cloud.

Again, it brings more community,

more customers.

More use cases, more 

capabilities that we can bring 

as part of one ecosystem.

>> That's exactly right.

>> That's awesome.

>> The next question comes in 

from Andrew.

It's -- another question 

actually to Nakita about the 

live demo we showed in 

integration of Vertex AI.

How does this work with BigQuery

ML or BigQuery machine learning?

Nakita, could you take that 

question? 

>> Absolutely.

That's a great question.

So for those of you who don't 

know what BigQuery ML is, it 

allows you to I build and train 

machine models with just a few 

lines of SQL.

So in the demo we showed how you

can work Vertex AI workbench to 

have access to essentially the 

BigQuery console but from a 

notebook interface, which I'm 

super excited about.

So you could actually create and

train your ML models in SQL and 

do all of this from the notebook

interface, but still have that 

connection to BigQuery and be 

able to use whatever Tableau 

data you have stored in your 

BigQuery.

>> Okay.

That's awesome.

Thank you, Nakita.

Next question comes in from 

Jeff.

Another question on looker.

Could you talk a little bit 

about how the Looker is enabling

these new sets of API-driven 

experiences, specifically, 

Jeff's asking, what are the 

considerations that we should 

have in place for the way we 

integrate it with other tools 

that we should be using? 

Could you talk a little bit 

about how we can now connect 

with Sheets, so there's some new

things that we connect with with

Looker.

>> Hey, Jeff, awesome question, 

and I do want to pre text it 

with the following statement.

Looker is going to be a key 

element of any data landscape.

Basically, what Looker is doing,

it's giving you two amazing 

things.

One is it gives you a model 

semantic layer, basically where 

you can describe your data 

landscape with very rich an 

notations.

And this semantic layer is 

connected directly to the 

database system.

For instance, when it runs on 

BigQuery, it completely 

delegates all of the queries 

right in to BigQuery so it 

delivers stellar performance.

And Looker as a whole, has a 

pretty amazing API-first 

concept, which means that it is 

so beyond AI, it allows you to 

build data-rich applications.

It allows you to basically run 

away to customer experience, to 

internal applications and make 

them really data rich.

And last but not least, you 

know, it kind of gave it away 

here, we are also integrating 

more and more products with 

looker semantic model.

For instance, we are adding 

connected sheets as a way how 

you can analyze and discover 

data described in look ML.

So check it out.

It's going to make a big 

difference in your landscape as 

well.

>> This is great.

We are almost out of time, so 

we're just going to take one 

more question before wrapping 

things up.

The last question is from 

Ferard.

He talks about how at USDA, many

of the methods are using 

different visualizations.

How does this complement our 

strategy with how we're 

connecting all this data.

It's over 50 petabytes of data.

How do we connect all that data 

with Earth Engine and enable all

these different ways to process 

it with all these different 

tools.

>> Absolutely.

Hey, great question.

So first of all, it starts with 

making sure that there is data, 

and with Earth Engine, you get 

this amazing data link of 

satellite imagery and GIS data 

available to you.

The second piece is that you 

need to have a powerful 

processing framework, and by the

integration to BigQuery, you can

use the most -- scale in the 

fastest warehousing system on 

this planet to analyze this data

alongside with all of the rest 

of your data, of your business 

data.

And last but not least, like you

said, it's about complete 

openness.

The announcements that we have 

shared today with Look ML allows

that you can connect top low, 

connected sheets, all on top of 

that right tool and make sure 

that you are using the tool that

look like the most, but they 

probably close it off, because I

think we are out of time.

Dane and I have a very important

message for all of you, and here

it goes.

>> Thanks to Gerrit, as well as 

our friends over on the demo set

for answering some great 

questions, and it's really been 

awesome hearing from all of you.

Be sure to hop back over to the 

next Web site.

Javier will share all the great 

things happening with Google 

Workspace.

Thanks so much for joining us.

>> Hello, everyone.

Welcome to Google Cloud Next.

All right.

We've had a lot of great content

so far.

And I have to say I learned a 

lot just now watching the data 

Cloud session.

I hope you're ready for even 

more.

I'm Javier Soltero, vice 

president and general manager 

for Google Workspace.

And I'm super excited to be with

you today.

Though, to be honest, I really 

was hoping we could all be in 

person by now.

Since flexibility is one of the 

key themes for today, we'll 

embrace what we have to work 

with, even if we can't be 

together.

Although the last 18 months have

been filled with uncertainty, we

continue to be inspired by 

customers and users who found 

new ways to create and stay 

connected.

Driving innovation and embracing

change are always challenges for

every business, whether you're 

ten people or 100,000.

The goal seems simple.

Empower your teams to work 

effectively together, in part by

Enduring that your technology is

an enabler, not a blocker.

As we've evolved Google 

Workspace, we've been focused on

helping individuals, teams and 

entire organizations drive 

innovation and greater impact 

with the tools they use every 

day.

And flexibility has been 

foundational to our approach.

It's why we decided to not only 

be Cloud first, but Cloud only.

It's why we've always 

prioritized user choice.

It's why we take a zero trust 

approach to security and why we 

make sure any product innovation

we introduce is truly built for 

everyone.

And those principles are core to

why our customers choose us.

Millions of companies, schools, 

government agencies and other 

organizations rely on Google 

Workspace to help them navigate 

whatever challenges they may 

face.

They're also a big contributor 

to our own continued success as 

a business.

Google has run on what is now 

Google Workspace for the last 

15-plus years, and it's part of 

why we have been able to 

continue to innovate and adapt 

as we've scaled.

In that time, we've grown to 

over 144,000 employees, made 213

acquisitions, added dozens of 

offices around the world and 

more than quadrupled the number 

of annual searches we support.

We've weathered changing market 

conditions and user preferences 

and competitive challenges, just

like any business, just like 

your business.

One constant for us has always 

been our tools, which were 

designed to meet ever-shifting 

needs and circumstances.

Today, we'll walk through some 

of the most impactful 

innovations in our tool set that

help unlock the full potential 

of individuals, teams and 

organizations in a flexible, 

more effective hybrid workplace.

First, let's talk about 

collaboration.

Effective team collaboration 

powers creativity and 

innovation.

It's how people work towards 

shared goals, build team culture

and are able to achieve 

substantially more than they 

would on their own.

With everyone's time in such 

high demand, and the explosion 

of collaboration tools giving us

no shortage of ways to reach one

another and work together, 

collaboration can often feel 

fragmented.

Conversations and work flows 

scattered across disparate 

channels.

Now more than ever, the 

technology you choose should 

work intelligently and effective

across every medium to enable 

collaboration wherever it 

happens.

Last month, we introduced 

Spaces, the central place for 

flexible team collaboration in 

Google Workspace.

Spaces are built to be tightly 

integrated with Calendar, Drive,

Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meets and 

tasks to provide a uniquely 

better way for people to engage 

in topic-based discussions, 

share knowledge and ideas, 

connect across organizational 

boundaries and build team 

culture.

All in the service of moving 

projects forward.

In the same way that a group of 

people can accomplish more by 

working together, our integrated

experience is greater than the 

sum of its parts, helping people

better collaborate and manage 

their time and attention.

By thoughtfully bringing 

together collaboration, surfaces

and channels, the goal is to 

help people stop thinking about 

where and focus instead on the 

what.

To continue investing in this 

area, we've been working with 

customers to understand their 

needs, especially the changing 

circumstances we've all been 

facing.

In line with feedback we've 

gotten, we'll be adding in-line 

topic threading, more powerful 

Search, robust security and 

admin tools for content 

moderation, and discoverable 

spaces.

We hope this makes it even 

easier for organizations and 

teams to both proactively share 

and find the knowledge they need

to deliver greater impact.

Those of us working remotely 

realized early on how crucial it

is to cultivate a sense of human

connection with our colleagues.

No matter where or how we work, 

we all need to be seen, heard 

and understood.

Towards that end, in the last 18

months, we've invested heavily 

in bringing functionality to 

Google Meet, that makes 

connecting virtually almost as 

natural and rewarding as 

connecting in person.

This includes AI-powered noise 

cancellation, low-light mode and

live translated captions, along 

with a new intuitive user 

interface, complete with polls, 

Q&A and breakout rooms that help

make meetings more productive, 

inclusive and immersive.

With all of these improvements, 

we're seeing customers who 

previously opted to use 

third-party meeting solutions 

reconsider moving to Google 

Meet.

We've also invested in making 

our tools reflect the new ways 

people are working, to support 

hybrid and distributed teams.  

We've added the ability to set 

working hours, work location and

recurring out of office 

notifications from calendar.

We also introduced the ability 

to RSVP to a meeting with a 

virtual or in-person location.

All these investments are geared

toward helping people better 

manage their time and ultimately

protect their well-being.

Well-being has been a central 

focus for us at Google over the 

past year, and for countless 

organizations supporting their 

employees during this long 

period of remote work.

Two clear, bright spots we've 

seen in pivoting to remote work 

have been, one, an increase in 

empathy for our co-workers' 

lives outside the office, and 

two, an increased focus in 

collaboration equity, where the 

ability for everyone to 

participate equally and fully.

For more than a year, we've all 

been reduced to digital video 

tiles, and it's had a 

democratizing effect on 

meetings.

We thought a lot about how we 

can sustain this equity as more 

of us move into a hybrid model.

Next month, we're launching 

companion mode, which offers a 

unified experience for people in

the office and their remote 

colleagues.

Those in the office can still 

use the best of in-room audio 

and video from Google-made 

hardware, but they can also join

the meeting using companion mode

on their laptop.

This lets them fully participate

in the meeting with access to 

chat, white boarding, Q&A and 

polls, along with the ability to

share content, just as they 

would from home.

We think it's imperative to 

provide one unified meeting 

experience regardless of where 

and how people connect.

And as more people head back in 

to shared physical spaces, we're

enhancing our meetings hardware 

to give organizations greater 

choice and flexibility.

We have two new all-in-one video

conferencing devices, the Google

Meet Series 1 Desk 27 and Board 

65, with new standards of audio,

video and white boarding 

capabilities built in.  

These devices can turn any room 

or shared space into a 

collaboration hub.

We also have new third-party 

devices coming to the Google 

Meet ecosystem, including this 

Logitech rally bar, and this new

Rayz Rally Pro Speaker doc, that

will automatically launch Google

Meet for video meetings and 

provide an improved audio 

experience from a mobile device.

Lastly, we're partnering with 

Cisco to bring interoperability 

between our video conferencing 

devices, so you'll be able to 

launch a Google meeting on WebEx

devices and WebEx meetings on 

Google Meet hardware.

This sort of partnership is 

crucial in delivering on our 

vision of Google Workspace for 

everyone.

Last year, our focus was on 

introducing an integrated 

experience across our 

first-party products.

This year, we're prioritizing 

strengthening the platform that 

supports and extends them.

This is so important, because 

our success is measured not only

by how people use and love our 

products, but by the ecosystem 

that thrives around them.

And what we're seeing in the 

numbers here is remarkable.

Google Workspace has more than 3

billion users and a stunning 4.8

billion apps have been installed

in Google Workspace to date.

There are more than 5,300 public

apps available in the Google 

Workspace Marketplace, plus 

thousands more private apps that

customers have built for 

themselves.

It really shows what's possible 

when you combine great ideas, 

easy-to-use APIs and the ability

to reach a user base that's 3 

billion strong.

While users and developers have 

been able to build on apps like 

Gmail, Drive and Docs for years,

we're now in the process of 

making it just as easy to 

integrate with Chat, Spaces and 

Meet.

If Google Workspace is how it's 

done, then the Google Workspace 

platform is how it's integrated.

Miro has already announced their

plans for integrating in Google 

Meet, and today we're pleased to

announce a new integration for 

Chat and Spaces from Atlassian.

Joining me now to share more, 

please welcome Atlassian's Chief

Product Officer, Joff Redfern.

Hey, Joff.

Great to have you with us.

>> Thanks for having me.

I'm delighted to be here.

>> You know, for those that 

aren't familiar with Atlassian, 

can you tell us a little bit 

more about it? 

>> Absolutely.

At Atlassian, our mission is to 

unleash the potential of every 

team.

Our team collaboration and 

productivity software helps 

teams organize, discuss and 

complete shared work.

But at the same time, we believe

there's no one tool to solve all

of the complexity of teamwork 

and collaboration.

Every team is unique.

Each team is its own snow flake,

and they should be able to use 

the best tools for the job.

We focus on building the best in

class collaboration solutions, 

and then deeply integrating it 

with all the other tools that 

teams need to get things done.

>> You know, it's so true that 

the nature of every role in team

within an organization, and the 

challenges they face, are 

unique.

Can you tell us a little bit 

more about the opportunity that 

Atlassian sees in building for 

Google Workspace and how you got

started? 

>> Yeah.

Today, Atlassian solutions 

already extend and connect with 

thousands of tools from 

collaboration, chat, 

security,devops and a whole lot 

more, and we're excited to 

continue to extend our 

partnership with Google 

Workspace to deliver for our 

joint customers.

Work is everywhere, people's 

chat, in inboxes.

It's all flooded with work.

And to help turn that clutter in

to progress, we believe in 

integrating Trello and Jira and 

our other tools everywhere work 

is.

The better together integration 

helps Atlassian and Google 

customers make work flow across 

their organization.

Rich content and easy actions 

help move work forward.

In fact, we are Workspace 

customers, and this is what led 

us to dream up our initial 

integrations.

One of our first launches 

together was the Trello 

segregation in Gmail, and that 

was back in 2017.

Today, more than seven million 

people have installed it, which 

is really impressive.

>> That's awesome.

Today, we're so excited to 

announce the new Jira bot that 

connects to Google Chat and to 

Spaces and enables users to 

create issues, monitor them, all

within the space that you are 

already using for collaboration.

>> Well, Workspace is unique in 

that it offers such a 

significant opportunity to reach

over three billion users.

And today, Atlassian and Google 

have invested in a number of 

Workspace products to help users

work better together, whether 

that's unfurling Google Drive 

links across Atlassian products,

embedding an important Google 

Doc in Jira work management or 

creating new Trello cards from 

Gmail.

But there's more.

And we'll continue to listen to 

our customers and then follow 

their needs.

>> It's great to see the power 

of Jira built in to Chat and to 

Spaces.

It's such a powerful example of 

how developers can build new 

experiences from across the 

platform, from Gmail to Chat to 

Spaces to drive.

Thanks, Joff.

Really excited to have you here 

with us, and I'm very excited to

continue to develop our 

partnership.

>> Thanks, Javier.

Have a great show.

>> As we work with Atlassian and

All our partners to build

and deliver new experiences, 

rest assured that every one of 

them is designed with security 

in mind.

Starting with a zero trust 

approach to identity in Google 

Workspace.

We also employ a rigorous 

vetting process to ensure 

partner apps are secure before 

becoming available in the Google

Workspace Marketplace.

Finally, we recognize that it's 

not always developers, but the 

person closest to the problem 

who best understands how to make

work more efficient and 

impactful.

To better empower these users, 

we're providing them access to 

custom, no-code Appsheet apps 

right from Gmail with dynamic 

E-mail.

This lets users interact to data

directly and securely from their

inbox to get things done in 

powerful new ways.

This experience is available 

today and you'll see it in 

action in the upcoming demo in a

few minutes.

Now, we've talked about the 

powerful new experiences in 

Google Workspace, and the 

platform that surrounds it, but 

neither of those can transform 

the way your organization works 

without a broader foundation for

security.

We've seen too many headlines 

lately about data and security 

breaches, and it's a powerful 

reminder that modern 

collaboration requires modern 

security.

Legacy collaboration tools were 

built for a by-gone era and 

these headlines make it clear 

that a band-aid approach to a 

security problem with legacy 

tools just doesn't cut it.

We built Google Workspace with 

modern collaboration and 

security in mind to keep your 

people and your data safe.

Let's talk about what makes 

Google's approach unique.

First, because we're cloud-only,

we don't have the same 

vulnerabilities that legacy 

collaboration tools and 

infrastructure have.

With Google Workspace, there's 

no need for thick client 

applications, E-mail attachments

or on-prem identity directories.

Each of which provide bad actors

with too many opportunities for 

attack.

And all our security protections

are included with Google 

Workspace, which means you don't

need to spend money on security 

add-ons, and you're less 

susceptible to supply chain 

attacks.

Second, our entire platform is 

built on the BeyondCorp security

model, which is Google's unique 

approach to Zero Trust.

This lets employees work 

securely from anywhere on any 

device without the need for a 

clunky VPN.

Finally, we're best in class at 

automatically detecting and 

preventing attacks, from 

phishing to malware to supply 

chain to ransomware.

Every day, we block 15 billion 

spam messages, 100 million 

phishing attempts and 3 million 

deceitful URL's from reaching 

our customers.

All of this comes together to 

provide Google Workspace 

customers with the most trusted 

way to connect, create and 

collaborate.

All right.

Now how are we working to 

enhance that security vision 

even further? 

Well, I'm excited to announce 

some new capabilities that build

on this unique approach to 

security.

First, we've already made 

client-side encryption available

in beta for Drive, Docs, Sheets 

and Slides, and now we're 

bringing it to Google Meet as 

well.

Client-side encryption gives our

customers complete control over 

the privacy and confidentiality 

of their data.

Next, we're introducing data 

loss prevention for chat.

You can think of this as part of

our promise to enable 

collaboration without compromise

when it comes to security.

With data loss prevention in 

chat, you can support 

spontaneous conversation while 

preventing sensitive and 

confidential information from 

leaking outside of your 

organization.

Admins can control what users 

share inside and outside their 

domain on Google Chat, and 

they're alerted about any 

violations.

Finally, I'm excited to share 

the Drive labels is now 

generally available.

This gives organizations the 

ability to classify files stored

in Drive based on their 

sensitivity level.

Labels also integrates with 

Google Vault, and Google 

Workspace data loss prevention 

to prevent external sharing, 

downloading and printing of 

sensitive files.

Just another example of how 

Google Workspace enables 

collaboration while providing 

the right controls to manage 

access and protect data.

So we've talked you through a 

lot today, and the common thread

is that we're continuing to 

build a modern productivity 

solution.

One that seamlessly brings 

together the right tools in the 

right way to help you more 

effectively collaborate, that 

supports hybrid and distributed 

work and that lets you extend 

and customize solutions for your

organization.

And of course, one that's secure

by design.

It's a platform that helps you 

unlock the full potential within

your organization so that you 

can innovate, even thrive, amid 

the disruptions of today and 

tomorrow.

There will always be certain 

things that are out of our 

control, but with the right 

people and tools in place, as 

we've seen firsthand with our 

customers, we can always be 

prepared to effectively adapt, 

no matter what comes next.

Though in this case, it just so 

happens that I actually know 

what's coming next, and it's our

demo with Eric Troutman, 

Director of Product Management 

for Google Workspace.

Stay tuned to see what we just 

talked about come to life.

>> Hello, everyone! 

I'm Erica troutman, product 

director for Google Workspace.

There has been a ton of 

innovation in Workspace this 

past year, and in the next 15 

minutes, I get to share with you

all the progress we've made, 

helping teams of all sizes to 

connect, create and collaborate.

This demo has two parts.

In the first, I'll be showing 

you Workspace in action through 

a little story that we've 

created, and then I'll hand it 

off to my colleague, Matt, who 

will show you all the ways 

developers with build on the 

Workspace platform.

And as a reminder, before we get

started, this is truly a live 

session, so you never know 

what's going to happen.

If you haven't already, click 

the button that says, "join the 

interactive experience" on the 

next Web site, and then we'll 

see you in the live room where 

you can interact with chats and 

do fun stuff like take polls, 

which we're going to try out 

right now.

How many employees have you or 

your company onboarded virtually

this year? 

Let us know in the poll below.

Under 10? 

11 to 25, 26 to 50 or more than 

50? 

I know that for me, recruiting 

and getting people in the door, 

that got harder during the start

of the pandemic, taking that 

brand new person that you worked

so hard to find, bringing them 

up to speed, making them feel 

like they're part of the team, 

and really enabling them to do 

great work, those critical first

few weeks on the job.

And of course, it is so 

overwhelming to be that new 

hire.

You're learning not just the 

role, but the tools, the 

processes, the people, and the 

culture, maybe remotely.

So I want to show you how 

Workspace is making this easier.

Please meet our hero, Pablo.

He is in exactly this position.

He's about to receive an offer 

letter from his dream employer, 

Symbol Manufacturing, which, by 

the way, is not a real company, 

in case you were wondering, so 

don't go look it up.

His hiring manager Allison is 

going to help onboard him at the

company.

Allison is really, really 

excited to get Pablo on board 

and there are a ton of steps in 

the process that she's going to 

help him through, so we'll show 

you how she uses Workspace to 

help streamline that experience 

for bochl both of them, even 

when it requires using third 

party software or custom tools, 

the symbol team built within 

Workspace.

The point here, as Javier 

mentioned, is that Workspace is 

a platform that brings together 

the right tools in the right way

at the right time, whether those

tools are built by Google or 

someone else.

Okay.

Before we get back to Pablo and 

Allison's story, let's see what 

you've been experiencing here in

the poll.

Wow, it looks like 48 percent of

you say that you've onboarded 

more than 15 people this year, 

that is a lot, so I think you 

are going to be able to relate 

to Allison.

When you were recruiting and 

onboarding, what was the first 

thing you did? 

I think probably you sent them 

an offer letter, and fingers 

crossed, hoped they signed it.

Allison uses the Docusign 

integration in Google docs to do

just that.

So here you see Pablo is going 

to check his personal G mail.

On his mobile phone.

And oh, he just scrolled past 

it.

There's an offer letter in 

there.

He's going to click on that and 

open up Docusign within the 

E-mail.

He clicks the nice cover letter 

Allison has sent him, clicks to 

open the document itself.

Okay.

Great.

Start date is right.

They spelled his name right.

Salary is what they talked 

about.

I think he's going to accept.

He signs the offer letter with 

his finger right there on his 

phone without leaving G mail.

Come on, Pablo, sign! 

Sign! 

And he signs and clicks submit, 

and Allison is so relieved.

In other systems, Pablo might 

have had to stop what he was 

doing, open another tab to 

review and sign the agreement, 

go back to G mail, hopefully 

remember where he left off.

It's just unnecessarily 

disruptive if you're signing a 

single contract.

But if you're someone who 

reviews and signs contracts all 

the time, it's incredibly 

onerous.

So deep integrations with 

leading third-party apps like 

DocuSign save you valuable time 

and keep you focused on your 

core job.

Audience, if you have any 

favorite Google Workspace 

integrations, we would love it 

if you would share those in the 

comments because it's a great 

way to help everyone who's out 

there -- everyone who's there 

discover the best of what's out 

there.

All right.

Back at Symbol, when Pablo 

returned his offer letter, that 

kicked off the onboarding 

process.

So let's see what happens next.

Pablo's now at home, on his 

personal G mail, and he sees an 

E-mail from Allison come in at 

the top there.

He opens it and notices, hmmm, 

this is not a typical E-mail.

This is an Appsheet dynamic 

E-mail, which allows him to 

interact with the forum without 

ever leaving his in box, so he's

selecting his laptop, accessory 

type, desk type, T-shirt size, 

really important, he enters his 

address, clicks submit, and just

like that, Cymbal can now send 

him his stuff.

This is especially important 

because Pablo is going to work 

remotely initially.

Just like with the DocuSign 

example, the dynamic E-mail lets

him complete his tasks where he 

is, in G mail, saving him the 

time and hassle of toggling back

and forth between tabs and apps,

just to fill out a form.

And, by the way, throughout any 

of this, if you have questions 

regarding dynamic E-mails or 

Appsheet, please comment below 

so that we can address them in 

the Q&A.

Let's fast forward to Pablo's 

first day on the job.

He's received his equipment.

He's excited to work.

He's in calendar and notices, 

ooh, he's got a one-on-one with 

Allison coming up.

He's going to click on that 

calendar invite.

And join the meeting with 

Allison.

Allison welcomes him to Cymbal, 

offers to give him a short 

overview of calendar and meet.

So here she's showing him how to

set up his working location and 

working hours so that his 

colleagues, who are global, know

when he's available and when 

he's off.

Features like these only 

available in Google Workspace, 

really improve employee 

well-being and overall job 

satisfaction.

They help employees better 

coordinate how and when to work 

together, enduring both 

productivity and time to 

recharge, even though our 

offices might be in our bedrooms

or our kitchens.

Honestly, Pablo is going to 

spend a lot of time in meetings.

So Allison shows him all the 

great new features that have 

been added to Meet over the past

year.

The interface is new, and easier

to use.

Here she's showing him how to 

get into some of the advanced 

features.

He's definitely going to want to

turn on noise cancellation, 

which is great for filtering out

dogs barking or neighborhood 

construction.

And if you're having trouble 

hearing someone, you can just 

click on the closed caption 

button to follow along in live 

captions, even in a different 

language than what's being 

spoken, which blows my mind.

AI powered translated captions 

in meetings are launching soon, 

and only Google Workspace offers

this built-in for everyone.

There's also a host of new 

features which she's showing him

here to boost engagement.

So Chat, Polls, these magical 

little breakout rooms that she's

going to show that transport you

to smaller groups where you can 

brain storm, white boards, 

integrations with Google Docs.

At this point, the one-on-one 

wraps up, and Allison suggests 

he goes into G mail and start 

exploring the spaces he's been 

added to.

We recently launched Spaces, 

which are the evolution of rooms

in Google Chat, and they're the 

central place for team 

collaboration in Google 

Workspace.

Pablo looks at the team space 

and notices his team has written

him a bunch of welcome messages,

which is really great.

He responds.

And now he's going to browse the

spaces that are available to 

him, and he discovers one 

particularly relevant to his 

work, quality inspectInspector s

North America.

Awesome.

That's him.

In this space, he can connect 

with his colleagues, discuss 

ideas and collaborate on 

projects easily.

Spaces are unique in that 

they're tightly integrated with 

the entire Google Workspace 

product set.

So calendar, drive, doDocs, Shes

and Slides, meetMeets and Tasks 

bringing all the tools you need 

to engage in topic-based 

discussions, share knowledge and

ideas, move projects forward, 

and build communities and team 

culture.

Pablo notices there's a little 

bubble with Allison's image, 

which means she sent him a 

direct message.

Turns out this is Pablo's first 

project, and Allison shared a 

document with him, which we can 

see in the preview here.

Pablo opens the document, and 

notices his co-workers already 

pre populated some of the core 

information.

So facilities, number of workers

per facility on the floor and 

types of tasks that they pe

perform.

Pablo's job is to optimize the 

process that managers use to 

create tickets and send them to 

their quality inspectors on the 

front line.

Okay.

To do this at his prior company,

Pablo would have needed to 

secure IT assistance at a 

minimum, and more probably a 

contractor and probably a budget

to go build an app.

So not fast, not easy.

Instead, Pablo's going to Use 

Appsheet.

He connects his sheet To 

Appsheet, and after about an 

hour of customization, he's 

created a quality inspection app

that his team can use.

So he opens it up to file his 

first ticket to one of his 

quality inspectors.

Now what? 

All right.

Over on the manufacturing floor,

we meet Adu, a quality inspector

reporting to Pablo, and he's 

just received a pop-up 

notification on his phone with 

the inspection ticket Pablo 

assigned to him.

So he pulls up the Appsheet app 

that Pablo created and performs 

the inspection.

He's going to take a picture of 

the completed job.

Let's see if he -- we can get 

him over there in to the 

Appsheet app.

He noticed -- yeah, there we go.

All right.

He's now in the app.

And he's going to take a picture

of the job once it's completed.

He's going to annotate that, and

submit it as closed, and that, 

then, will notify Pablo on 

Pablo's side of the app.

So hopefully you saw how easy 

that was to make collaboration 

more efficient between an office

and front-line worker.

He used a really simple but 

powerful Appsheet app to 

eliminate the whole back and 

forth between E-mails and chats 

and then maybe switching to an 

external ticketing system, and 

then more E-mails and more app 

-- more chatting.

At this point, if any of you can

think of useful -- for Appsheet 

in your organization, please 

share those with us in the form 

below.

So think about all of those 

repetitive tasks that make you 

crazy day to day.

Those are the kind of things 

that app sheets can automate for

you.

All right.

Back to Pablo.

Let's see if we're -- okay.

Still on Appsheet here for just 

a quick second.

We're going to get back to 

Pablo's day-to-day in his first 

week on the job any moment here.

Let's see.

I'm looking here.

You guys have some really 

interesting -- oh, scrolling 

through here.

Asana, people like that 

integration.

I saw people use hello sign.

That stuff is all fantastic.

All right.

Are we back to Pablo? 

We're back to Pablo.

Back to Pablo.

It's the end of his first week 

on the job.

He pulls up calendar in the side

bar while in G mail, and he 

notices he should be joining the

team meeting.

So he clicks to join.

On the call, Allison introduces 

Pablo to everyone and asks him 

to share his reflections on his 

first week.

And he is really proud of the 

app that he built in Appsheet, 

especially since this is a tool 

the entire team can adopt.

He shows how easy it is to 

create requests, assign one to 

an inspector, follow the status.

He also pulls up the request 

that he sent to Adu that was 

already completed.

And if Pablo were joining from a

conference room, because 

hopefully some day he will, he 

can use companion mode, a 

feature that's only available in

Google Meet to seamlessly join 

and share from his laptop while 

using in-room audio and video.

And with some congratulatory 

emojis from his colleagues, 

Allison closes off the meeting, 

and the weekend can begin.

I think it's fair to say that 

Pablo helped us with quite a lot

of demos in his first week on 

the job, so thank you, Pablo.

And I hope that you can see how 

at every turn Google Workspace 

helps people connect and 

collaborate to get more done 

with an intuitive and integrated

set of tools.

With that, I'd like to introduce

my colleague, Matt, who's going 

to take us under the hood and 

talk about how you can build on 

the work space platform.

>> Thanks, Erica.

Hi, everyone.

I'm Matthew, and I'm lead 

product for the Google Workspace

platform.

Under that hood is a powerful 

engine.

Let's talk about how you can 

take advantage and build on the 

Workspace platform.

As Javier mentioned, more than 

4.8 billion apps have been 

installed in Workspace to date.

This stunning number illustrates

Workspace is more than a hunt 

for work, it's a powerful 

enabler work flows.

The opportunity to build on the 

Workspace platform is massive.

Nearly half the world's 

population is already using 

Workspace.

That's a huge audience.

Whether you want to grow an 

existing business app or build 

an entirely new business on the 

platform.

To help you build experiences to

reach these 3 billion users, we 

delivered a range of tools so 

you can innovate, from no quote 

options like Appsheet, as Erica 

discovered, to powerful 

scripting with app script, to a 

complete set of easy-to-use 

API's.

And we've been listening to your

feedback.

Developers want to use their own

preferred language in tools when

building integrations like 

Workspace add-ones or shoutouts,

or even using our large 

collection of rest API's.

So we've opened up the platform 

to support development with any 

tools, any language, on any 

public cloud.

Of course, if you're using 

Google Cloud, why wouldn't you? 

Take advantage of Cloud Run, 

cloud Data Store and cloud AI to

power your app.

So there's a big opportunity to 

build on the Workspace platform,

with the tools and languages of 

your choice.

Now let's take a look at how the

process works across the three 

core stages of app development, 

the design, develop and publish 

phases of your app.

Starting with the design phase, 

we have created the card builder

tool.

This tool allows you to lay out 

the visual design and user 

experience of your app.

There are a range of templates, 

and you can also drag and drop 

components of the app around, 

l.

But for more davensd developers,

you also have the ability to see

the code in the editor, and make

updates there as well.

As we move on to the develop 

phase, you now have a range of 

language and tooling to choose 

from, whether using options from

Google like app script, or your 

own preferred language and 

tooling.

While App Script is a great 

option for developers, we have 

invested in and extended the 

Google Workspace platform to 

embrace a wider range of 

industry-standard tools, so 

developers can use their own 

text stack and reuse their 

existing code when building for 

Workspace.

When your integration is 

complete, congratulations! 

You're ready to publish it.

For public use in the Workspace 

marketplace, where it will be 

available for billions of users.

It's worth noting that there are

more than 5,300 publicly 

available apps in the 

marketplace today.

This number really highlights 

the diversity of use cases and 

remarkable opportunity for 

developers in building for 

Workspace.

And of course if you're 

developing a custom app for use 

in your own organization, you 

have the ability to publish that

app privately so it remains 

exclusively for the use of your 

organization.

So there you have it.

A quick tour of how you design, 

develop and publish new 

integrations for Workspace.

Now let's hear from you, what 

Workspace platform technologies 

are you curious to learn more 

about throughout the conference?

Is it developer tools and 

languages? 

Like app script oScript Or Apps 

Or maybe it's product 

integrations through add-ons or 

shoutouts.

Or perhaps data API's or data 

access through Workspace API's.

But that's enough about the 

technology platform.

Why don't we take a look at a 

few real world examples of 

integrations developer work 

space, and let's start with the 

copper CRM add-on for G mail.

Copper identified a problem.

Workspace users needed a simple 

but powerful CRM solution that 

is built to work for apps and 

Workspace.

So naturally, they built the 

solution.

Here you can see it in action, 

as a sales rep receives an 

E-mail from a customer.

The copper add-on detects the 

E-mail.

After installation, the copper 

add-on will detect the E-mail 

and pull up the customer 

information automatically.

But the customer's information 

right next to their E-mail, so 

we click through the 

installation, we will eventually

get to -- there we are.

As you can see, the cop per 

add-on has detected the E-mail 

and pulled up -- 

With the customer's information 

right next to their E-mail, the 

sales rep has all the insight 

they need from copper, and can 

craft the best response to the 

customer.

All without leaving G mail.

Copper is a perfect example of 

business that has grown 

alongside Workspace, and today, 

100 percent, yes, that's 

correct, all of their business 

comes from Workspace customers, 

these are customers who value a 

best-in-class solution with 

deep, native integration to 

critical Workspace apps, such as

G mail, Drive and Calendar.

The opportunity to build for the

Workspace platform spans 

multiple surface areas.

So let's take a look at how this

looks in chat anChat and Spaces 

the brand new Jira bot from 

Atlassian.

Here, you can see a customer 

service rep jumping into the 

customer success chat space to 

report an issue with a customer.

After a short discussion in the 

space, the rep creates an issue 

in Jira, via the Jira bot.

Every time there's a status 

update on the case, the Jira bot

will update the team members in 

the chat.

This saves the entire team 

valuable time they might have 

spent going back and forth to 

Jira, and check updates.

It also helps the team focus on 

collaborating together to help 

the customer instead of 

navigating their tools.

We would love to hear what 

Workspace integration, or apps 

you're using or would like to 

see.

Please share in the comments so 

that the community hears what 

are some of the best.

These are just a few examples of

how developers are innovating in

Workspace, and driving business 

value for themselves and their 

customers.

We can't wait to see what you 

create and innovate on 

Workspace, whether it's a 

notebook app or a professionally

developed solution.

Either way, we've provided a 

rich canvas here for you to 

start with and believe the best 

is yet to come.

So look at the chat.

It looks like you're excited to 

get going and ready to get 

started.

Visit 

developers.Google.com/Workspace 

to learn more about integrating 

with Workspace.

>> Thanks to my colleague, Matt,

for taking us under the hood 

with Workspace today, and a 

special thanks to you, our 

audience, for your engagement.

We love seeing your comments on 

Chat.

Now stay tuned for our live Q&A,

covering everything from our 

spotlight and this demo.

Thank you so much! 

We'll see you soon! 

>> All right.

So we want to hear what's your 

role at work? 

Do you work in the IT 

department? 

Are you a developer? 

Are you a person who uses 

Workspace just in the process of

your daily work, or something 

else entirely? 

Let us know in the chat.

L

All right, Javier, while we wait

for those results, why don't you

answer a question for us.

>> Let's do it.

>> Tell us, what are you most 

excited about in Workspace these

days? 

>> Well, I'm excited about the 

pace at which we're delivering 

some amazing new capabilities 

for people.

But I'm most excited about the 

way we're bringing the Workspace

products closer together and 

helping people be that much more

effective at getting their work 

done, collaborating with their 

coll

colleagues, building documents, 

basically coming -- translating 

ideas and turning them in to 

reality by using our products.

It's very exciting and we can't 

wait for all the stuff that 

we're going to come out with 

this year and next.

>> Absolutely.

And I feel like, as I've seen 

the chats coming in, customers 

are talking about examples of 

how they're using Workspace, how

they're going to use some of the

new Appsheet innovation in G 

mail, so it's really exciting.

Okay.

Our poll results have come back 

in, and it looks like, do you 

want to read the results? 

>> Yeah.

Well, it looks like we have 

pretty even split between our IT

folks and developers, which is 

great and consistent with, like,

one of the key -- there's a lot 

of great content for all of you 

at Next, and then we also have a

healthy portion of end users and

other folks.

So widening the audience, trying

to make this a highly relevant 

topic for a lot of people.

Not just technology 

professionals.

People use this every day, so 

I'm excited so see this many 

people.

>> Absolutely.

All right.

Let's jump in with our first 

question.

>> Let's do it.

>> It comes from Lucy, who says 

I saw the news about the new 

Work Safer Program.

Can you tell us a little bit 

more about that? 

>> Sure.

Thank you for the question, 

Lucy.

So we're announcing Work Safer 

as a way to bring the best of 

Google Workspace and from Google

Cloud Security together to help 

companies rise to the growing 

threat of cybersecuritiness 

acci 

incidents, et cetera.

So it brings together Google 

Workspace with some exciting 

innovation from our security 

team and from those customers 

that have broader, more diverse 

environments, we've partnered 

with two of the best names in 

the security business, Palo Alto

networks and clCloud Strike to 

provide a complete solution for 

these companies to remain secure

in a much more challenging 

environment.

>> That's great.

That's great to hear.

Kind of an all-in-1 solution.

All right.

Let's move on to question number

2.

And this one is going to be for 

Erica.

And it comes from Michael who 

asks, is it hard to collaborate 

if members are using different 

platforms to join? 

For example, he's running off of

Google's tool set that has a 

partner who's using a different 

platform.

>> Yeah.

This is a really important 

question, Michael, thank you for

that.

I think the reality is that we 

live in a world where there's 

different different sets of 

products that you or your 

partners or your customers are 

going to be using, and it's 

fundamental to, you know, our 

way of viewing the world that 

Workspace should not be a wild 

garden.

It should intersgrate.

It should connect and make those

tasks easier for you.

So on the Drive Doc Sheets side,

we invest really deeply in 

making interoperability with 

Microsoft in particular, totally

seamless, and very easy to use.

So, for example, you can open up

Microsoft documents in the 

Google editor and have the full 

interactive experience.

Those changes will be saved back

to your Microsoft document, 

including comments.

All of those changes are updated

in real time.

But there's also a really 

important third party c

compatibility component, which I

would love for my colleague, 

Matt, to discuss.

>> Yeah.

It's fundamental to us, that 

whether using tools which 

interoperate with the Workspace 

su

suite, or things that complement

the types of functionality that 

we offer, that these all work 

together.

I'll take one example.

We recently announced our new 

partnership with Miro, which 

does virtual white boarding or 

collaborative canvassing, and 

you can imagine that as you're 

working with that tool set, not 

only are you building things on 

your canvas, but you're 

scheduling meetings, you're 

holding meetings at which you 

want to collaborate in real time

while changing things within 

that tool.

And so what we are doing is 

making it really easy for you to

schedule a meeting in calendar, 

join a meeting in meet, at the 

same time be working in your 

Miro white board.

So yes, we believe very strongly

that all these things should 

work better together.

Workspace and partners, a really

great experience for our 

customers and users.

>> That's great.

Thank you.

All right.

Our next question comes from 

Bambang, who's with Chandra 

Osrey and asks must we have or 

use G mail or company E-mail for

using the rest of Google Cloud 

and Workspace? 

I think Erica, this is probably 

one for you.

>> Sure.

Yeah.

Happy to take that.

We have tailored offerings that 

don't require you to migrate 

E-mail.

So Workspace essentials is 

perfect for that.

It includes the Workspace 

product set, but without E-mail,

so it integrates easily, and we 

also have deep interoperability 

with Outlook and Calendar.

>> Got it.

Great.

Javier, we're going to move to 

you next, and the question comes

from Hannah, and Hannah says 

that her team loves new 

features, like being able to 

jump right in to a Meet from a 

Doc, and is wondering, will 

integrations like that be 

extended to other apps inside 

Workspace? 

>> Yes.

In fact, we're very excited to 

continue to advance the 

opportunity of bringing, you 

know, to start, actually, from 

the real-time collaborative 

experience that Google Docs pine

neared, now I think 15 years 

ago, I believe yesterday was our

15th birthday.

One more and we can drive, and 

be able to allow users to go 

from working in real time with 

others in a document to easily 

getting into a live video feed 

where you can hear and see each 

ot

other.

And so that progression, I 

guess, is a really important 

part of enduring seamless 

collaboration, and it applies, 

we see, to both our own editors,

as well as, as Matt mentioned, 

third parties over time.

>> Yeah.

Got it.

>> Yeah.

>> Makes sense.

Well, we're going to stay with 

you, Javier, for this next 

question, which comes from 

Carter, who says my company uses

a lot of point solutions like 

Zoom and slack, in addition to 

having Microsoft and Google 

licenses.

So what would you say is the 

argument for consolidating? 

>> Well, look, one of the 

strongest aspects of Google 

Workspace is the element of 

choice, the choice that users 

make, billions of users have 

made to select individual 

products for key roles in their 

lives, at work, et cetera.

And so we're guided as we refine

these products by that sense of 

affinity that people have to the

approach that we bring.

That approach is best expressed 

and nurtured, I think, through 

deeper and interintegration 

between our products to create 

something that's ultimately new,

and at the same time we 

recognize that there are other 

companies around us in this 

vibrant ecosystem of ours that 

offer different points of view 

and different aspects of what we

also provide, and we believe 

that there's ample opportunity 

for users to make an informed 

choice and really recognize, 

comes down to familiarity with 

the products, the sense of 

security that you get from an 

integrated solution, and 

ultimately the cost.

So it's a choice everyone makes,

and over time, we feel really 

good about the continued growth 

of our ecosystem.

>> That's great.

That's great.

Thank you.

Erica, we're coming back to you 

with a question from Miles, who 

asks, how do you plan to win 

over die-hard fans of Excel and 

other Microsoft creCreation too 

>> All right.

A good, challenging question 

from Miles.

Well, as Javier said, we 

introduced Docs and Sheets about

15 years ago, and that 

fundamentally rethought what a 

file should be.

Our belief is that these 

experiences need to leverage the

best that the internet has to 

offer.

So inter actactivity, connectiv 

and data.

And they shouldn't just be a 

physical -- a digital 

representation of a physical 

piece of paper that lives on 

your hard drive.

And that's in stark contrast to 

the mental model that, you know,

Legacy Solutions have evolved 

from.

Over the years, we've invested a

ton in user experience and 

making this incredibly easier to

adopt.

And the great thing about all of

this ease of use which billions 

of people take advantage of, 

which is has Google Security, 

you know, enmeshed in 

underpinning the whole 

experience.

I would call out a couple of 

features that I hope people are 

aware of but if they're not, 

they should be.

So Connected Sheets, for 

example, if you weren't aware, 

allows Sheets users to analyze 

billions of rows of data, yes, 

billions, in a single sheet, so 

that really pushes the envelope 

for what a productivity tool can

do, and our innovation around 

Smart Canvas, which really super

charges interactivity, 

intelligence and connection to 

rich data in the form of these 

modular building blocks that 

transcend the file boundaries.

So we bring in smart chips that 

bring rich information about 

people, events, files, 

templates.

We have tables and task lists.

All of that really further 

enhances what these files should

be.

So what I would say is for any 

of the die-hard Microsoft fans, 

we would love to give you a 

tour, and I bet we could change 

your mind.

>> Got it.

Great.

Thanks, Erica.

All right, Javier, we're coming 

to you next with a question from

Juliet, who comments that there 

have been a lot of security 

breaches lately in the news, and

what are we doing from a 

Workspace perspective to protect

customers from these sorts of 

attacks? 

>> Well, look, it's a great 

question, and thank you for the 

que

question.

A lot of these attacks originate

from the architecture and habits

that went along with legacy 

products, right? 

The sharing models, the approach

for storing content, a reliance 

on heavy, powerful clients that 

store a lot of information 

locally on them, but don't 

necessarily provide the best 

degree of security.

Google Workspace was born in a 

different era, and has had, 

since the very beginning, a 

different point of view about 

the design and the approach to 

security, and it comes, I guess,

as part of us being cloud only, 

right? 

Like, we grew up, and were 

arch

architected for the distributed 

world in which we live in now, 

and it is the reason behind why 

our products are so effective.

So we've continued to invest 

around that to make it even 

clearer how, along with 

enhancements and innovative 

capabilities from Google Cloud 

Security, like BeyondCorp, et 

cetera, we establish a 

completely different model for 

securing content while ensuring 

the absolute best and most 

effective level of collaboration

within a company, and beyond a 

company, so externally with 

other third parties, et cetera, 

in partners.

>> Absolutely.

So it's really architected to be

safe in this world.

>> Yes.

Yes.

And actually, look, you 

mentioned this idea of habits, 

right? 

Like, these -- the notion of 

attachments, right, like the 

model that people grew up with, 

you know, when productivity 

tools, digital productivity 

tools were first introduced, is 

the main vector through which a 

lot of these ransomware and 

other terrible things tend to 

start, right? 

Somebody, you know, either opens

an E-mail, like a phishing 

attempt, or a malicious 

attachment, something that gets 

spread through, you know, 

various different tools that 

people are used to using, and 

companies are really desperate 

to say how did we actually put a

stop to this, and by the way, 

can we do that in a way that 

actually works us towards a 

sense of transformation in our 

company.

So it's not just about securing 

your communication and 

collaboration, but ultimately 

taking that full opportunity to 

make it more effective at the 

same time.

So it's pretty exciting.

>> Yeah, it is exciting.

And, you know, you have been 

working in this space for so 

long.

You mentioned the legacy tools, 

and, you know, from -- to work 

at different companies, you've 

been so focused on the 

productivity market.

What have you learned across 

those different experiences and 

different products that is most 

important, and the knowledge 

that you use today? 

>> Well, listen, I think the 

most honest answer to that 

question, and it may surprise 

some of you, is you can't please

everybody, right? 

You're building products that 

play these very crucial roles in

people's personal lives, at 

school, at work, and part of 

their power is that they are 

horizontal in nature.

They allow people -- they're 

canvass for creation, 

articulation of ideas, et 

cetera.

And so you have to be very 

careful and deliberate about the

process you use to evolve those 

products.

And so as I mentioned earlier, 

you know, we began our journey 

as Google and the collaboration 

space in a very particular point

in time, where it allowed us to 

have a different point of view, 

a more modern approach, and an 

eye towards simplicity that 

didn't undermine the 

sophistication and power of the 

products that we were doing.

That's what we are really 

strongest at.

And so as a result, the task of 

evolving those opinions in 

products like Docs Or Sheets or 

G mail or Meet, any one of these

products, they are the 

representation of a point of 

view that Google is bringing 

that customers are actually 

info

informing, and helping us refine

over time, but it ultimately 

requires that we really 

understand what it is that we 

believe the right result is for 

our customers, and that may 

mean, in some cases, that these 

products are uniquely powerful 

for key scenarios, and are not 

necessarily just like something 

that can be used for -- they're 

not multi-tools, right? 

>> Absolutely.

>> So it's a really exciting and

challenging journey for us.

>> Absolutely.

And having that strong point of 

view, it's a great opportunity 

to get feedback from all the 

customers who are living -- 

listening now.

Please, share your feedback in 

the chat.

We want to hear from you.

All right.

We have another question, it's 

coming in from John, and it's 

going to be for Matt, and John 

asks, what are you doing to 

encourage developers and ISV's 

to build for Workspace? 

>> Yeah.

Thanks for asking the question.

I know we talk a lot about 

customers and users, but at the 

heart of a successful platform 

is developers, and so what makes

the developer want to build on 

the platform? 

Let's start with our open 

philosophy.

Google as a company, for a long 

time, has believed in the 

openness of data, the openness 

of access to platform, and that 

extends to work space.

We built an extensive set of 

API's and frameworks, and they 

are completely open.

You can go build something 

today, right now.

Second is reach.

If you are building something on

a platform, you want an 

audience, right? 

You want to build a business on 

a platform, you want to have 

success, your customers have 

success, and we have -- or 

Workspace certainly has a lot of

reach.

We're talking about 3 billion 

users, millions of paying 

businesses and paying customers.

And this is fundamental for why 

you want to be on the Workspace 

platform.

Finally I mentioned API's and 

frameworks.

We've put a lot of effort in to 

making sure that they are easy 

to use and easy to build on.

When I say easy, easy from a 

developer point of view.

It shouldn't take you months and

months to deduce how it works.

It should be something that you 

could build up prototype in an 

afternoon, and we believe that 

we have made it that way for 

you.

And finally, you've seen a lot 

of logos on our slides today and

our discussion points today.

These are really proof points.

Atlassian, Miro, DocuSign, to 

the success that our partners 

are having, and the fact that we

believe in being better 

together.

>> Absolutely.

Thanks, Matt.

Okay, Javier, we're coming back 

to you.

>> Okay.

>> With a question from Laura.

>> Hello, Laura.

>> Laura is asking, with COVID 

still keeping a lot of companies

remote, what is Google and 

Google Workspace team doing to 

offset the difficulties of 

distributed work? 

>> A lot, is the honest, 

simplest answer.

Now, look, I think there's a -- 

it's a two-part answer.

From one side, as an 

organ

organization, 2007 listen to 

people.

We have to get feedback from 

employees.

We've learned a lot from each 

other, and about the different 

situations that our employees 

have to face on a daily basis.

It's informed our point of view,

as I mentioned earlier, this 

idea of having an opinion.

We know that just because work 

doesn't take place in a specific

named location anymore, that 

there aren't, like, a whole host

of new problems and 

opportunities that you have to 

address, not just with products,

by the way, but also with 

policies that accompany the 

adopt, like recovery days and a 

home office stipend, et cetera.

Now, from a product perspective,

we have this incredible 

opportunity to channel those 

learnings, along with the input 

that we get from our customers 

from around the world, and even 

our users, to say, how are we 

helping and how can we be more 

helpful, I guess, in such a 

broad, uniform sense of the 

word, by helping people not just

use these products, but be 

successful with them, and again,

this involves a whole lot of 

listening, which is why I'm 

great to have -- it's, you know 

-- the dynamic experience here 

with Cloud Next and also all 

these great conversation with 

users and customers that we've 

been having everywhere.

So, you know, it's a 

never-ending task.

>> Absolutely.

Across two parts.

The org and the product.

>> That's right.

That's right.

>> All right.

Well, it looks like we are out 

of time.

So I'd like to thank everyone 

for joining us today, and a huge

thank you to Javier, Erica and 

Matt.

>> Thank you, Katie.

>> Of course! 

It's great to be here all 

together.

Thank you everyone online for 

joining in today, and I'd like 

to remind you that even though 

we've finished the live Q&A, the

day is not over yet, and there's

actually another great session 

that's about to begin shortly, 

and it's from our own chief 

diversity officer, Melonie 

parker who's going to be leading

a DEI spotlight session that 

talks about the importance of 

STEM and creating pathways to 

jobs in tech.

It's a really important topic 

and I hope you all tune in to 

check it out.

The details are on the next Web 

site.

Thanks so much for joining us.

Bye.

>> Thanks, everybody.

>> Hello, everyone.

My name is Melonie Parker, and I

am Google's chief diversity 

officer.

I would also like to introduce 

Melanie, who's with us today.

She's going to be providing ASL 

interpretation.

It is great to be back for my 

third Google Cloud Next.

This time, for a look at 

nurturing and developing 

pathways to careers in tech.

Today, I'd like to talk about 

how building a more diverse, 

inclusive culture is not just a 

competitive advantage for us at 

Google, but it's a 

responsibility as well.

And as we get started, I want to

let you know that the chat is 

open so you can engage with each

other during this session.

I want you to share thoughts, 

share where you're tuning in 

from, and we'll have a few of 

our folks on hand to join the 

conversation.

We'll also get in to what we're 

doing to widen pathways to tech 

careers at Google and across our

industry.

But first, I am so proud to say 

that Google is committed to 

making diversity, equity and 

inclusion a part of everything 

we do.

From how we build our products 

to how we build our workforce.

I work hand-in-hand with our 

CEO, Sundar Pichai, and as part 

of our executive leadership team

to bring our global DEI strategy

to life.

I also lead a passionate group 

of people whose work touches 

every 140,000 employees, 

stretches across nearly 60 

countries, and helps millions of

users who use our products and 

our platforms to run their 

households, their businesses and

their lives.

And personally, I travel down a 

very unlikely path to land this 

position.

I'm a black woman who grew up in

a small town in North Carolina.

My brother and I are proud 

alumni of HBCUs, and we were the

first generation in our family 

to bring home a college degree, 

which I earned at a historically

black university, Hampton 

University.

And unlike many of my peers, I 

didn't have anyone at home to 

explain the unwritten rules of 

corporate America, or to help me

navigate my career.

Instead, I cobbled together a 

community of mentors, managers 

and inspirational voices who 

helped me find my path.

And that's an idea that I want 

to focus on today.

Access, opportunity and 

networking are critically 

important building blocks for a 

successful tech career.

And that's especially true for 

folks like me who come from 

non-traditional backgrounds.

Too many people from 

under-represented communities 

find themselves confronting 

systemic inequalities, such as a

lack of access to STEM education

or access to high-speed internet

that disrupt the pathway to tech

careers.

And for many who do navigate the

pathway, we've seen how the 

weight of inequality can foster 

a sense of imposter syndrome 

once on the inside.

It's that sinking feeling of 

doubt in our abilities, and a 

feeling like a fraud, or that we

don't belong, and that for some,

it will linger for an entire 

career.

Overcoming inequality and 

creating access to opportunity, 

including for our 

under-represented talent, this 

is a top priority at Google.

And we're taking decisive 

actions that create 

opportunities and steadily grow 

a workforce that reflects the 

world around us, to launch 

programs that support our 

communities globally, and to 

build products that better serve

all of our users.

In other words, to build for 

everyone, we need to weave 

diverse perspectives into every 

step of our design, engineering 

and testing processes, and 

innovative ideas can come from 

everyone, from Googlers at the 

grassroots level to engaged 

leaders and to established 

diversity councils across the 

company.

As an example, the Google Meet 

team worked on the light 

enhancement feature to better 

represent all skin tones in an 

inclusive way during our video 

calls, and through feedback from

a diverse group of testers, the 

team was able to determine the 

right algorithm that better 

worked for all individuals 

across the skin tone spectrum.

And this ensured that all video 

calls on Meet work well for 

everyone, and it was thanks to 

the collaborative work and 

questioning, how to make 

products equitable for all.

In another example, Google has 

internal teams to foster equity 

through technology, empowering 

our black + community to 

innovate in the digital space by

supporting their educational 

journey and helping them land 

roles in the tech industry.

And we've also built external 

programs like Cloud Career Jump 

Start.

It's a 12-week learning course 

for under-represented students 

with computer science or 

information systems-related 

majors, or the relevant 

experience, and it offers free 

access to Google Cloud, 

Associate Cloud engineer 

training to prepare for the 

certification exam.

We just published our diversity 

annual report, and I am excited 

to share that 2020 was our best 

year yet for hiring our Black + 

and Latinx + Googlers in the 

U.S.

It was also our best year ever 

for hiring women in tech in the 

U.S. and globally.

In addition to hiring, we're 

also re-doubling the focus on 

retaining Googlers from all 

under-represented groups, and in

full transparency, this is an 

area where we can and we must do

better.

Google depends on the best, 

brightest and most diverse 

talent to not only help us solve

today's challenges, but also to 

co-create solutions to 

tomorrow's problems.

So we are building a lasting 

model of inclusion and belonging

that helps all employees feel 

seen, connected, supported, and 

I hope proud to be in service.

Belonging is key to 

re-recruiting our workforce and 

acknowledging that not everyone 

experiences our culture the same

way.

Despite our best efforts, some 

team members are still feeling 

left out.

There is work to do around 

building the culture that we've 

all been working so hard to 

co-create.

Clearly, there's some other 

missing element.

And as different as we are, we 

all have the same underlying 

need to feel valued, to feel 

like our contributions matter, 

to feel like we belong here.

But being included isn't 

necessarily feeling like you 

belong.

Being invited to the table is 

not the same as being welcome at

the table, and being valued like

you belong.

Personally, I've been inspired 

by the work of John Powell.

John is an expert in the areas 

of civil rights and civil 

liberties, and he's a professor 

at Berkeley, and he leads the 

Institute of Othering and 

Belonging, and he looks at our 

primal need as humans to belong.

And what fosters belonging and 

what prevents it.

And if you think about it, one 

of our primal fears is to be 

ostracized by a group.  

Aside from food and shelter, we 

need to belong.

And we've evolved to ensure that

we could maintain access to the 

resources that the group has.

Many behaviors are dictated by 

this need to be accepted by 

others.

But we're also guided by the 

fear of losing that very 

acceptance.

And we've evolved to protect 

ourselves and our loved ones by 

determining who's in and who's 

out, and that comes down to 

identifying who's the least 

risk? 

Those that we perceived most 

like us and relegating those who

aren't to the out crowd.

And John calls that primal 

sorting of people in to ins and 

outs.

The cool kids versus the 

non-cool kids, as othering, and 

we don't necessarily do this 

consciously, but it is the 

behavior that stems from our 

unconscious bias.

The subtle ways that we send 

messages, even virtually, of 

who's cool and who's not, who's 

valued, who's not.

And that's why I believe that 

our work, it's not truly 

possible until we foster this 

sense of belonging.

And as evolved humans, we have 

control over this.

There are ways to check in with 

ourselves, noticing, are we 

turning inward, focusing on only

who and what we know, versus 

turning outward to connect with 

and explicitly work with other 

groups, and to seek ways to 

build common ground.

And that would foster belonging 

and empathy.

And this means that we need to 

co-create the workplace 

experience with our internal 

communities, and redefine what 

it means to be a Googler by 

acknowledging where we can do 

better.

And by enduring everyone feels

like they belong, is positioned 

to do their best work, and can 

confidently bring their 

authentic whole selves to work 

each day.

And for under-represented 

talent, this can make the 

difference between surviving and

thriving in their career.

And for those of you who are 

accustomed to muting parts of 

who we are, authenticity 

empowers us to do our very best 

work.

Last summer, at the start of the

global racial justice movement, 

I realized that I could no 

longer code switch or check 

parts of myself at the door in 

an act of self preservation.

Definite

To lead our deep work in racial 

equity and address the systemic 

and structural barriers, I 

needed to reconcile the most 

vulnerable parts of my own 

identity as a Black woman, with 

the Black woman who happens to 

lead diversity at Google.

And I know that this is the type

of workplace environment that we

strive to build.

And with our collective, 

consistent efforts, that is what

we'll do.

We know that Google is most 

helpful when our products and 

our services reflect the needs 

of the people who are using 

them.

To best serve our diverse global

community of users, we need a 

more representative workforce, 

and while we're making progress,

we know equalities persist 

around access, opportunity and 

networking for under-represented

talent, but through investments 

in creating pathways to STEM, 

and with help from allies, we 

can broaden the talent pipeline,

improve product design, and 

fulfill our mission of making 

DEI part of everything that we 

do.

What does this look like? 

There's a real cognitive shift 

happening both inside and 

outside of Google around 

diversity, equity and inclusion 

and how we can best build for 

everyone.

Externally, we're creating 

pathways to careers in tech as 

early as elementary and high 

school.

We're expanding recruitment 

beyond the usual campuses like 

Stanford, Berkeley, Harvard, 

Yale, and doubling down on 

higher education institutions 

like Hispanic-serving 

institutions, and historically 

black colleges and universities 

serving under-represented 

talent.

Why? 

Because we know that 25 percent 

of Black graduates with STEM 

degrees, for example, they come 

from HBCUs, just like the one I 

attended.

So this year, we began deepening

and sustaining relationships 

with HBCUs.

In June, we announced an 

historic, unrestricted $50 

million grant that allows the 

presidents of these esteemed 

institutions to allocate 

resources in the manner that 

they see fit.

We're also broadening career 

pathways to include a major grow

with Google career readiness 

investment that supports our 

Hispanic-serving institutions 

around the U.S.

A significant economic 

opportunity grant for workforce 

development and digital skills 

training to thousands of 

Hispanics, and a career 

readiness program for Native 

American, indigenous serving 

institutions.

And that's just a slice of the 

work that we're doing 

externally.

And while I mentioned that 2020 

was Google's biggest year in 

terms of hiring Black and Latinx

talent in the U.S., we know that

there's much more work to do 

inside of Google to retain and 

grow our talent.

So broadly speaking, we've 

developed racial equity 

education for all Googlers, and 

incorporated it into our new 

hire orientation.

We've doubled the size of our 

retention and progression team 

and we're on the path to triple 

this team by 2022, and this 

enables us to provide one-to-one

support like coaching, 

networking and internal mobility

opportunities to help 

under-represented Googlers grow 

and thrive.

And we rolled out an innovative 

onboarding program for our new 

Black Googlers so that they feel

more supported right from the 

start.

Our employees want to know that 

they can grow and thrive with 

us, and that's one reason why 

we're working to increase 

leadership representation among 

women, Black and Latinx 

Googlers.

We've introduced pathways to 

sponsorship for women in 

technical leadership roles.

It's designed to accelerate 

their careers.

We leverage partnerships with 

more than two dozen community 

and professional organizations, 

and these partners offer 

professional development, as 

well as networking opportunities

for under-represented Googlers.

We also offer skills building 

initiatives like the Cloud 

Technical Residency Program, and

with great intention, we've 

begun building a culture of 

belonging for all Googlers, as I

described earlier.

We've been very open about our 

successes and our challenges, 

and I invite you to explore this

further at diversity.google.com.

Now, I know many of you are 

wondering what can I do? 

So as you weigh your own 

strategies around engagement and

retention, consider the role of 

allies in driving results.

Allies can be leaders, managers 

and peers.

They support folks in 

marginalized groups to which 

they don't identify.

Internally, we've created a 

number of pathways for allies 

that are seeking to support our 

under-represented colleagues.

These include an allyship 

pathway with group exercises for

allies and resources for 

practicing or encouraging 

inclusive behaviors.

We also have Google in 

Residence.

Experience Google's software 

engineers, teach introductory 

computer science classes on HBCU

campuses, and we have faculty in

Residence.

We have more than 50 faculty 

members from 30 HBCUs to design 

project-based industry-informed 

content and to implement that 

content in their classrooms.

Google has doubled in size in 

the past few years.

We know our DEI commitments need

to keep pace.

Operating at this global scale, 

it heightens our sense of 

responsibility around DEI, and 

to paraphrase my colleague, 

Annie Jean-Baptiste, there's no 

blueprint to doing this 

perfectly.

And while we don't have all the 

answers, we're eager to share 

what we've learned and also to 

learn from others.

And in the spirit of learning 

leadership, I hope I'll be 

invited to share more 

discoveries and progress at 

Google Cloud Next 22.

In closing, when our mission is 

to build for everyone, we have 

to work with everyone.

So with help from allies and 

through smart investments and 

creating pathways to STEM 

careers, I am confident our 

talent pipeline will flourish.

Real, meaningful change can take

years.

We know.

But there's no need to wait for 

change to come.

If you haven't already, please 

head over to the chat room and 

join the discussion.

There, you can share some of 

your successes and your 

challenges around creating 

pathways to tech careers.

This kind of dialogue can open 

minds and truly inspire change.

I look forward to sharing more 

progress with you next year, and

I'll bring others along who have

been on this journey with us to 

share their experiences.

Thank you for wrapping up Day 1 

of Google Cloud Next with me.

It's been great sharing this 

time with you.

We look forward to seeing you 

all here tomorrow for Day 2, 

which kicks off with our 

developer keynote.

Until then, be sure to register 

atg.co/cloudnext for access to 

all of our content, and join the

conversation on social using
