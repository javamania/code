ANDI GUTMANS: Hi, everyone.

I'm Andi Gutmans,
general manager

and VP of engineering for
databases at Google Cloud.

Thank you for joining us
for Google Cloud Next.

We have some exciting product
announcements to share with you

in this session.

Digital innovators
are disrupting

traditional industries in new
ways because of their ability

to use data and software to
deliver new digital customer

experiences.

Customers expect personalized
and seamless experiences

across their devices, in all
places, and at all times.

To deliver these next-generation
digital experiences,

developers need to be
empowered to build apps faster

by leveraging fully
managed databases,

use their existing
skills and investments,

and build their apps for
success with databases that

were designed to power the
most demanding workloads

in the world.

We offer best-in-class databases
for always-on applications,

with global reach
and unlimited scale.

Google Cloud is committed to
open source and open standards.

We offer managed
services that are

fully compatible with the most
popular open-source engines,

such as MySQL,
Postgres, and Redis.

We manage the complexity
of running your database

so that they are simple to
use and operate, and make

app development faster
and easier for you.

Leading organizations in
all regions and industries

have placed their
trust in our databases.

And our databases remain
one of the fastest growing

segments of Google Cloud.

In the newly
published Gartner 2021

"Scorecard" for operational
databases, Google Cloud

received an overall
score of 90 out of 100,

which is higher than the score
of the largest alternative

cloud provider.

Google Cloud met 100% of the
required criteria outlined

by Gartner.

Also, Gartner predicts
that 75% of databases

will be deployed or migrated to
a cloud platform by next year.

Imagine 40 years
of databases placed

on-premises being superseded
by cloud databases

in such a short duration.

It's amazing.

Our customers'
journey to undergo

data-driven transformation
typically involves three steps.

The first step,
migrate, is there

to help customers move
existing applications

and databases to the cloud,
frequently on a tight timeline.

Customers need a
fast-track approach

to lift and shift what they're
running today to the cloud.

This as-is migration already
adds tremendous value,

even if it doesn't
provide the full benefits

of cloud-native capabilities.

Once migrated, many
of our customers

seek to modernize their
database environments

by transitioning off
expensive legacy databases

and onto open-source databases.

For customers looking to build
next-gen applications entirely

in the cloud, they're
in the transform phase.

This is about unlocking
new possibilities

in competitive differentiation.

It's about delivering new
transformational customer

experiences and innovative
business models.

For your existing databases
that you need to easily migrate

to a fully-managed
cloud service,

we offer Cloud SQL, with
full compatibility for MySQL,

Postgres, and SQL Server.

It is one of the fastest growing
large services in Google Cloud.

Cloud SQL offers
easy integration

with existing apps and
Google Cloud Services,

like Google Kubernetes
Engine and BigQuery.

More than 650,000 GKE pods
securely connect to Cloud SQL.

And BigQuery users
query over 125 petabytes

of data in Cloud SQL
on average in a month,

using our federated
querying capabilities.

We've invested heavily
in improving Cloud SQL

and making it enterprise-ready
for your demanding workloads.

In the past 12 months, we
have introduced capabilities,

such as cross-region replicas,
point-in-time recovery,

customer-managed encryption
keys, VPC Service Controls,

and IAM support.

We have significantly improved
the maintenance experience

for customers and given
them maintenance controls.

Cloud SQL maintenance
is, on average,

80% shorter than it
was 12 months ago.

And maintenance for
My SQL and Postgres

is now shorter than that
of competing offerings

from other cloud
providers, based

on figures published in
online documentation as

of August 2021.

Earlier this year, we launched
industry-leading observability

with Cloud SQL
Insights for Postgres.

It empowers developers to
address database performance

issues themselves at
no additional cost.

This has become one
of the fastest adopted

new capabilities in Cloud
SQL, and we look forward

to delivering
equivalent functionality

across more database engines.

In addition, we recently
introduced Cloud SQL Cost

Recommenders with Active
Assist that empowers developers

to better manage costs.

We have made migrations to
Cloud SQL easier and faster

with the Database
Migration Service.

This offers a simple experience
with minimal downtime

for reliable and predictable
migrations to Cloud SQL.

It is serverless,
secure, and offered

at no additional charge.

More than 85% of all migrations
are underway in under an hour,

and a majority of customers
are migrating databases

from other clouds.

Database Migration
Service currently

supports MySQL and
Postgres databases,

with support for SQL Server
migrations coming soon.

For customers bringing Oracle
workloads to Google Cloud,

we offer our bare metal
solution for Oracle

that allows you to run Oracle
databases the same way you

do it on-premises,
but cost-effectively

and with less than 2
milliseconds latency

to all of your GCP services.

Bare metal solution
enables you to continue

using your existing Oracle
technologies, such as RAC,

Data Guard, and RMAN.

For workloads that require
microsecond latency,

we offer Memorystore.

Memorystore is fully compatible
with Redis and Memcached,

and offers an easy migration
destination for your Redis

and Memcached workloads.

Memorystore is a scalable,
secure, highly available

in-memory service that is used
by 90% of the top 100 Cloud

customers.

We recently announced a
preview of Datastream,

a serverless change data
capture and replication service.

With Datastream, you can
easily and seamlessly

deliver change data streams from
your Oracle and MySQL databases

into Google Cloud Services, such
as BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Google

Cloud Storage, and Spanner.

The serverless
architecture of Datastream

transparently scales up
or down, as data volumes

shift in real time.

Now let's discuss our
transformative databases

and how they can help you
transform your business

models and the digital
experiences for your users.

Today, your business-critical
applications

may need to serve millions
of users across the globe

and process data volumes that
are an order of magnitude

higher than just
a few years ago.

New, always-on business models
require these applications

to be reliable, secure,
and continuously available.

Your applications need to
scale seamlessly and sustain

high performance, even during
unexpected spikes in demand.

We give you access to the same
databases that power the most

demanding Google applications,
like Search, YouTube, Gmail,

Maps, and Payments.

Google had to invent
these databases

because traditional
databases were not

designed to handle
these demands for scale,

availability, and performance.

We offer not one, but three
such transformative databases--

Spanner, Bigtable,
and Firestore.

All three of them
have a common set

of highly differentiated
core attributes,

like industry-leading
five 9s availability

SLAs, no maintenance
downtime, unlimited scale,

automatic sharding,
zero-touch global replication,

automatic failover,
superior price-performance,

and enhanced security
and compliance.

Spanner is our fully
managed relational database

that offers the
familiarity and developer

experience of a
relational database

and the scalability
of a NoSQL database.

Spanner enables unlimited
scale, so you can easily

accommodate future growth
without painful architecting,

adjust your capacity on-the-fly,
and pay for only what you use.

It allows you to deliver
high-performance transactions

with strong consistency
across regions and continents,

so you can simplify
operations and place data

close to your users.

Our enterprise customers in
financial services, gaming,

retail, technology, and
many other industries

run some of their most
demanding operational workloads

on Spanner.

With Spanner, you
can spend less time

worrying about how to
scale your database

and instead focus on
scaling your business.

As wonderful and
unique as Spanner is,

it wasn't the most accessible
database for developers.

We wanted developers to be able
to start small with Spanner

so they could design their
applications for success

from the get-go.

To this end, we
recently introduced

more granular instance
sizing for Spanner

to democratize access to it.

With more granular
instance sizing,

you can start at 1/10 the
cost of regular instances,

equating to approximately
$65 per month.

This means you can
start small and easily

scale your Spanner instance
as your workload grows,

with no downtime.

Developers love the scale
and availability of Spanner,

but they wanted to take
advantage of Spanner

using their familiar open tools
and their existing skill set.

Therefore, to continue this
theme of democratizing access

to Spanner, we're
excited to announce

the preview of a Postgres
interface for Spanner,

starting today.

This empowers developers
to take advantage

of Google's transformative
relational database

using standard tools and skills
from the popular Postgres

ecosystem.

This interface combines
the power and reliability

of Spanner with the familiarity
and portability of Postgres

to enhance flexibility.

By providing a
Postgres interface,

we're democratizing access
to Spanner for millions

of developers and ISVs.

Starting today, you can
create Spanner databases that

use PostgreSQL
dialect and connect

with its OpenWire protocol.

This interface supports
Spanner's rich feature

set using most popular Postgres
data types and SQL features.

Postgres interface
for Spanner is

available at no
additional charge.

What this means is that for
your Postgres workloads,

we offer you not one, but
two fully managed services.

For maximum compatibility
with open-source Postgres

and for the easiest
lift-and-shift migrations,

you have Cloud SQL for Postgres.

For your most
demanding workloads

where you need unlimited scale
and five 9s availability SLAs,

we offer Spanner with its
new Postgres interface

that allows you to leverage
your skills and investments

in the Postgres ecosystem.

We're super excited about
our rich Postgres offerings.

Now for apps that require
consistent single-digit

millisecond latencies and need
to support millions of requests

per second, we offer Bigtable.

Bigtable is our fully
managed NoSQL database

for large operational
and analytical workloads.

And it's HBase-compatible.

Bigtable is uniquely capable
at powering use cases

like personalization at
scale and fraud detection.

We're excited to share that
autoscaling is coming soon

to Bigtable.

This will allow Bigtable to
automatically add or remove

capacity in response to changing
demands of your workloads,

so you'll only pay for
the capacity you need.

We talked about the
importance of the velocity

of your application iteration.

For rapid app
development, we offer

Firestore, our fully
managed scalable

serverless document database.

Firestore is beloved
by developers because

of its ability to serve
both as a document database

and a backend as a service.

Firestore enables
offline support

with real-time synchronization.

An example of how
much developers

love Firestore is
that Firestore has

more than 250,000 monthly
active developers and Firestore

apps power more than 750
million monthly active users

using Firebase authentication.

Not only is Firestore
extremely developer-friendly,

but we're also focusing
on making Firestore

more enterprise-friendly.

We're introducing a
number of enhancements

to Firestore for greater
enterprise readiness.

With that, I'd like to introduce
one of our most innovative

customers who has
successfully accomplished

a data-driven cloud
transformation.

It is my pleasure to invite
Kumar Menon, SVP of data fabric

and decision science
technology at Equifax.

Kumar, thank you for
joining us today.

We would love to hear
about Equifax's innovation

that you and your team have been
driving in partnership with us.

KUMAR MENON: Thank you, Andi.

I wanted to start off by giving
you some background on Equifax

and the transformation
we are under.

Equifax is a leading data
analytics and technology

company and is one of the three
biggest credit rating agencies.

We are present in 24
countries worldwide.

In 2018, we embarked on
a massive company-wide

transformation to
modernize our technology.

This was a result of an
unfortunate breach incident

in 2017, which brought
the global spotlight

onto our company.

Due to the oversight that
was placed on us and the need

for us to ensure we are good
custodians of the high-fidelity

data we have, we realized
that patching and modifying

our legacy systems would not
be a sustainable solution.

We made the bold decision to
adopt a cloud-first strategy

and rewrite all of
our data platforms

and associated
applications, leveraging

cloud-native architecture.

Our legacy systems
were operating

in silos, which made it
difficult to effectively

innovate and monetize
our differentiated data

assets through new
multi-data products.

So we also took this
as an opportunity

to reorganize our data under a
common enterprise domain model,

onto a single
global data fabric,

with the security and
automated governance baked

into the architecture.

The goal was to make it easier
for our data and analytics

and product teams to
innovate and deliver

new products
faster, thus helping

our customers and consumers
make better decisions.



Here's what our end-to-end
data flow looks like.

The data fabric is at the heart
of the Equifax value chain.

If you look at this
illustration from left to right,

the data fabric helps us ingest
different domains of data

we bring into our ecosystem
in a consistent, reliable,

highly-performant, governed,
compliant, and secure manner,

so that our product, data and
analytics, and business teams

can leverage the synergies
of all the data assets

to innovate and deliver products
that our customers need.

In short, we want global
data at our fingertips.

Equifax Cloud will enable our
product innovation, growth,

and competitiveness.

The data fabric platform is
pivotal to the Equifax business

model going forward.

Why is the Equifax data
fabric a gamechanger?

Let me give you a few examples.

Equifax has moved from
80-plus data silos,

enabling multiple
sources of data

to be standardized and organized
into a seamless data fabric

with logical separation
in governing groups.

The structure drastically
simplifies our architecture

and gives Equifax the
ability to act quickly

to address customer,
regulatory, and security needs.

We will achieve bolt-on
mergers and acquisitions

with better and faster
integrations than ever before,

accelerating our
growth tremendously.

Now let's look at a more
technical view of the data

fabric and see how we have
leveraged GCP-managed database

services to deliver our
analytics and operational

workloads.

Let me break those down
for you from top to bottom.

The data fabric
services shown here

help curate the
raw data we collect

across the various domains, such
as credit, employment, wealth,

utilities, et cetera,
to name a few.

We then key and
link the data, which

is a form of entity
resolution process

that helps us identify a single
unique instance of an entity--

for example, a unique
consumer identity--

across all the domains
of data we collect.

This data is then made
available for predictive models

and real-time decisioning as a
set of purpose-specific views

with the regulatory
rules applied,

thus ensuring permissible use.



This low-latency,
high-value ecosystem

leverages Cloud BigTable
as the core Datastore

and the pipelines are
built in Cloud Dataflow.

The Cloud BigTable
scalable architecture

and its support for
customer-managed encryption

keys help us provide a
resilient, reliable, and secure

data platform to support highly
stringent millisecond SLAs

that our customers
demand from us.

The data fabric
is tightly coupled

with our Ignite and our
analytics services, which

is used by our data scientists
for feature engineering

and building predictive
models, which

can be deployed into
our decisioning systems,

facilitating a full
ML ops ecosystem.

The data lake that powers
Ignite is built on BigQuery.

Our enterprise catalog services
are built on Cloud SQL.

This is what you see in
the middle of this picture.

It houses all of the metadata
for our data features

and models, plus the rules
that are applied on our data.

This provides the auditability
and the automated governance

capability.

This design gives Equifax
a leading position

as a data analytics
and technology company

in a highly regulated space.



Finally, I wanted to leave
you with some metrics of where

we will be when we are finally
migrated onto this platform.

You're looking at 75-plus
data fabric services deployed

in seven regions supporting
the 24 countries we operate in.

We would have 10 billion-plus
of observations keyed,

using almost 90,000-plus
clicking and linking rules,

enabling us to manage 800
million-plus unique identities

globally.

We are well into our journey
with significant production

traffic coming soon.

We have an aggressive
plan to grow

the company via acquisitions
and organically.

The partnership
we've had with Google

through this entire
journey has been great.

Both our engineering
teams have been

able to collaborate
closely to achieve

these capabilities and
the seamless access

to the product engineering
teams at Google have been key.

We have invested in a long-term
relationship with Google

and look forward to a
symbiotic partnership.

Thank you for having
me, and hope you

guys found this
presentation useful.

ANDI GUTMANS: Kumar,
thank you for sharing

your story of data-driven
cloud transformation.

It's truly inspiring.

We look forward to our
ongoing partnership

with you and Equifax.

At heart, Google
is a data company.

When it comes to
managing data, we

have to solve some of the
most difficult problems.

We re-imagined
databases and invented

Spanner, a database
that gives you

the best of relational and
nonrelational databases.

Our databases benefit from
disaggregated computing storage

and our privately-owned
global network

to improve performance,
scalability, security,

and availability.

What all this means is that when
you adopt our Cloud databases,

you immediately benefit from
our longstanding culture

of engineering excellence
and innovation.

There is a lot more
exciting content

waiting for you in
the upcoming sessions.

I invite you to join these
sessions to learn more

about Google Cloud databases.

And I would like to
thank you for joining us

at Google Cloud Next.

We hope to partner
with you to accelerate

your data-driven
business transformation.

Thank you.
