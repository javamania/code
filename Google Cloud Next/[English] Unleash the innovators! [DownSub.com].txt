JEANA JORGENSEN: Welcome to
Community Day at Next '21.

My name is Jeana Jorgensen.

And I'm here with Urs Holzle.

Today is unique in that
it will span an entire 24

hours to bring
together communities

from all around the world
in local time zones.

But before we get
into those details,

we wanted to share some
really exciting news with you.

URS HOLZLE: That's right.

But first, I'd like to thank
you all for your incredible

collaboration and
commitment to Google Cloud,

because developers are
really the core inspiration

behind everything that we build.

Your constant pursuit of
excellence motivates us.

And your feedback
pushes us to be better.

In a developer
keynote yesterday,

I announced the Google
Cloud Innovators Program.

With this program, we want
to bring all of Google Cloud

developers together
to co-create, to learn

from each other, and to
unite our global technical

communities where we're
supporting Google Cloud.

And we also want it to
reignite the human connection

that many of you have missed
over the last 18 months.

And that can be dismissed or
overlooked in online forums.

And finally, we know that
technical communities

can sometimes be
intimidating to new members.

And so our program's
primary design principle

is grounded in
inclusion and in serving

the community, regardless
of your knowledge base

or your status earned.

So I want to personally
invite each of you

to join us to become a
Google Cloud innovator.

So come share your experience,
coach and grow others.

Most importantly,
learn from each other

to build things that
have a meaningful impact

on the people who use them.

JEANA JORGENSEN: Terrific.

To join us, just sign up at
cloud.google.com/innovators.

We're really excited
to get to know you.

We also wanted to let you know
about a dedicated technical

community event we will
host for the first time

this coming February.

Twice a year in different
regions around the world,

we'll bring the users and
creators of Google Cloud

together to brainstorm,
learn, and get hands

on to move projects forward.

Google Cloud innovators will
be eligible for invitations

and speaking
opportunities early.

So please sign up to
be an innovator today,

and we'll share more details
about the event in the coming

weeks.

Urs, we've got a few more
pieces of good news to share.

URS HOLZLE: All right.

Yes.

We continue to invest
heavily, of course,

in developer experiences through
intuitive in-product usability

or through community engagement
to offer deeper recognition

of your expertise or through
access to tools and resources

that help you get your job done.

And another key investment is
in our learning experiences.

So, for example,
to meet the demands

of cybersecurity
professionals, Google

has pledged to train
100,000 Americans in fields

like data privacy, data
analytics, security,

and IT support.

And additionally,
"Tech News World"

cited that over
90% of IT leaders

expect to expand Cloud
Services over the next one

to three years, but over
80% identified a lack

of internal skills and
knowledge as a top barrier

to Cloud success.

And according to another study
done by Global Knowledge,

Google Cloud skills are
in super high demand,

commanding the top two paying
it certifications in 2021

in the US.

So I'm very happy to announce
Google Cloud Skills Boost.

Google Cloud Skills Boost is
the definitive destination

for Google Cloud learning,
including 700 labs, courses,

learning paths, skills badges,
and certification resources all

authored by Google Cloud.

The platform is
available globally today

in English, Japanese,
and Spanish,

with more languages
to follow soon

to enable millions of
people to build and validate

the skills that they need
to thrive in an evolving

Cloud-first world.

And finally, to
reaffirm our commitment

to accessibility of
these learning resources,

we are offering access at no
cost for 30 days to Google

Cloud Skills Boost.

So visit the website to
access free training today.

JEANA JORGENSEN: Fantastic.

OK.

Before we get on to the details
of how Community Day will run,

I have got two
questions for you.

OK, first question,
Google Cloud has

been talking about empathetic
engineering for quite some time

now.

Can you tell us a little bit
more about what that means

and why you think it strengthens
developer experiences?

URS HOLZLE: Sure.

By empathetic
engineering, we really

mean, how are we
putting ourselves

in the shoes of our
users, the developers,

and ensure that we build
products and services that

really start with
your needs first?

We've always been an
engineering-led company.

So what we needed
to learn was really

how you wanted to use our
services because users come

with different challenges
and different backgrounds

from different
industries, some of them

new to Cloud technologies.

So that's where customer
empathy comes in.

As an engineer, do you really
understand the experience

that real users have
with your products?

Are you really walking
in their shoes?

So we implemented a
listening and learning system

based on customer empathy.

So for example,
teams test products

by performing common user
journeys just the same way

customers would without internal
help, without internal tools,

without insider tips.

We gather the feedback.

We improve the services
or the documentation

and then test it
with real customers.

So we keep iterating until
we're confident that we've

built intuitive
services that are

easy for developers
to implement and build

great solutions around.

JEANA JORGENSEN: Great.

Thank you for that.

So here's my second
question for you.

If you were starting your
career in technology today,

where would you
focus your learning?

URS HOLZLE: Wow,
that's a huge question.

Because technology
evolves so quickly

that it can be
pretty overwhelming,

especially if you're
early in your career,

and unfortunately because of
the digital transformation

of many industries, the
success of those organizations

will increasingly depend on
the services and products that

are built by its developers,
so learning really

is super important.

Based on what I've
seen, I would probably

start with these three things.

First, you have to dedicate time
for learning every single week,

right?

So I'd start out by determining
what forms of learning work

for you independently
of the subject and then

really allocate a set of hours
to grow your knowledge base.

So for some, reading works best.

For some, it's videos.

For some, it's
interactive events.

You just got to understand
what works out for you.

And so next, I would pick
a couple of topic areas

that really interest
you and start

learning the fundamentals.

Joining online
communities or forums

can be a really good way to
get different perspectives

on the subject that maybe aren't
in the standard traditional

learning paths.

And then finally, of
course, the question

is, well, what subjects
should you go after?

Now, there's hundreds of them.

And so that's really
something that depends on you

and your preferences
and your situation.

But I'd say three
areas kind of come

to mind for me, first
customer empathy.

I already talked about it.

It's not something
that's taught in schools,

but it's really,
really important

that we build technology that
people actually want to use,

right?

And so when design
a product, and you

start with a deep understanding
what the customer actually

needs, then you can really
build more than just a solution.

You can create a viable
business and a viable product

that really lasts.

Second, learning what it
takes to ship a product,

also not broadly
taught in schools,

it's really invaluable in
almost every job that I've seen.

So that includes things like
the fundamentals of release

processes, lean or
agile development,

and how you best design products
for self-service delivery

because you want to
design your product such

that users can start
using it quickly

rather than depend on some
complicated instructions

or deployment process.

And then last but
not least, security.

You've all heard about
the growing cyber threats

that so many
organizations are facing.

And they're only going to get
more sophisticated and more

invasive.

And so security is
something that you

need to build into your product
and in your development process

from the beginning.

You can't bolt it on later.

So learn about the fundamentals
of securing a product

or system, and then
keep up with the trends.

So that will give
you the confidence

that you need to build long-term
viable products or companies.

JEANA JORGENSEN: Right.

Really great advice.

Thank you for that.

I know it'll be especially
important for new developers

and early-in-career folks.

So thank you.

I mentioned earlier
that I'd give you

a quick rundown of Community
today and how it would unfold.

So let's do that now.

Right after this, there is
a special spotlight session

featuring Jim
Hogan, a health care

strategist in Google
Cloud alongside Vint

Cerf, the co-creator of TCP/IP
and who has often been coined

the father of the internet.

The two will have a
candid conversation

about accessibility
in the workplace.

We think it's going
to be a great session.

And we really, really are
excited to have you join us.

After that, we'll head into
the heart of Community Day.

You can join us in an immersive
gathering experience called

Kumospace, which creates virtual
campus with meeting rooms,

smaller spaces to hang out
for one-on-one conversations,

and then larger auditoriums
for more common topics.

Every single part
of the day will

be powered by Google
Cloud, including Kumospace.

So the day kicks off
with conversations

led by Google Developer
Groups across Europe, Middle

East, and India, and
then the rest of the day,

we'll have a variety
of experiences

and community gatherings
with a few topics

available at each time block.

The first time
block, you can attend

discussions led by Googlers
and community members

like our Google Developer
Experts and expert innovators

dedicated to specific
technologies like Vertex AI,

secure software supply
chain, Flutter, or Workspace.

And then the second block, you
can follow a specific community

pathway and spend time with
specialized groups like Kaggle

data scientists or
Women Techmakers or even

region-specific groups.

And the third and final
track throughout the day

will have dedicated
spaces for learning--

how you can earn a
Cloud certification,

develop new skills in
hands-on lab sessions,

or even apply your skills for
good and philanthropic-related

competition with
other attendees.

We really look
forward to seeing you

and hope you enjoy
the rest of the event.

Join us next for the
DEI spotlight session

with Jim and Vint.

Thank you so much for spending
the last few days with us.

Remember to sign up for
Google Cloud innovators

and become part of our
Google Developer family.

We're excited to get to know
you and spend more time with you

in the future.

Enjoy the rest of Next.
