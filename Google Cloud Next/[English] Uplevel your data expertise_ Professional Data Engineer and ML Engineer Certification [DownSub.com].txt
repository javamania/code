DOUG KELLY: Welcome
to our session,

uplevel your data expertise,
professional data engineer

and professional ML
engineer certification.

I'm Doug Kelly and I
now oversee learning

offerings for machine
learning and AI solutions

on Google Cloud.

Previously, I worked as an ML
engineer and data scientist

at Google Cloud and oversaw data
science content at Coursera.

I now spend my time
thinking deeply

about industrializing
machine learning development

on Google Cloud and driving
the creation of training

to prepare learners such as
yourselves for data and machine

learning engineering careers.

In this session, I
would like to start off

by discussing two key data and
machine learning challenges

that enterprises
are facing today.

The gap between data platform
investments and realizing value

from them and the scarcity
and corresponding high demand

for data and machine
learning engineering talent.

This will frame our discussion
on how Google Cloud is

addressing these, both through
data and machine learning

platform innovations as well
as through our industry leading

professional certifications,
the professional data

engineer and professional
ML engineer certifications.

I hold both of
these certifications

and will share my
perspective with you

on the benefits of
these certifications

as well as the
recommended learning

path and resources for each.

Lastly, I will
give you a preview

of what's coming next
for data and machine

learning training from
Google Cloud learning.

My goal for the
session is that you

walk away excited about building
data and machine learning

solutions on Google Cloud
and you start or level

up your learning journey
towards certification today.



One of the bigger
challenges for data teams

is turning into a
competitive advantage

the immense, fast growing,
and fast moving amount of data

that our organizations, our
customers, our partners,

our ecosystem is creating.



According to IDC, 175
zettabytes of data

will be created in
the next five years.

One zetabyte equaling
1 trillion gigabytes--

that's 21 zeros.

Our data production
has more than 10xed

in the last eight years.

In fact, 90% of the
data in the world

has been created in
just the past 10 years.



Yet, when it comes
to turning data

into business outcomes and
business value for companies,

the situation is quite alarming.

Over 2/3 of the data produced
is never actually analyzed.

And almost 70% of
companies say they're

unable to realize tangible and
measurable value from data.

The key takeaway is this,
delivering value with analytics

and machine learning
requires a modern data

platform such as Google Cloud.

Data engineers are essential
to build, operate, and maintain

these data platforms to
enable business value.

And machine learning
engineers, in turn,

build and deploy machine
learning solutions

on top of a robust data platform
to drive decision making

and the realization of value.



Data engineers and ML
engineers work closely together

on data teams to
close the data value

gap by tightly integrating
data and machine

learning infrastructure.

In industry, we know
that machine learning

has had the most business impact
by scaling real-time decision

making and personalization.

That means we have to act fast.

To do so, we need data engineers
enabling data processing

and analytics speed
and ML engineers

to deliver predictions that
arrive at the point of action

and real time.

That's the difference between
discovering and preventing

fraud, purchases and
cart abandonment,

and proactive and
reactive customer service.



Google Cloud is simplifying data
analytics and machine learning

through each of
the platform design

pillars outlined on this slide.

We deliver serverless
analytics, allowing customers

to keep development velocity
high and their focus purely

on analytics versus
infrastructure.

We offer a comprehensive set
of data analytics workloads,

from batch and streaming data
processing to data warehousing

to business intelligence.

We provide the services
for our customers

to operationalize machine
learning solutions,

from pre-built ML APIs to
AutoML to BigQuery ML to custom

TensorFlow and PyTorch models.

We enable the best open source
data technologies to give you

flexibility and choice.

And we build for enterprise data
and machine learning workloads

at any scale.



Google Cloud is already a
recognized industry leader

with a purpose built, end-to-end
data analytics and machine

learning platform to support
the entire data team anywhere,

on premise or on Google Cloud.

Data engineers are able to
leverage services like Pub/Sub,

Dataflow, and Data Fusion to
ingest, prepare, and transform

data at any scale.

They can also leverage
new data services

like data plaques and
analytics hub and market

leading analytics services,
such as BigQuery and Looker,

to manage and quickly
surface enterprise data

sets and insights to
the entire organization.

Announced at Google
I/O this year,

Vertex AI is also rolling
out as the successor

to AI platform for machine
learning development.

It provides ML engineers with
an integrated suite of services

to help enable each stage
of your ML workflow,

from gathering data to feature
engineering to building models

and, finally, deploying
and moderneering

these models in production.

For example, new
Vertex MLop services,

like Pipelines
and Feature Store,

give ML engineers
reusable ML workflows

while Vertex Predictions
gives ML engineers

a scalable, serverless
solution to get

model predictions into
decision making UIs faster.



Depending upon how you define
the machine learning market,

if you look at platforms like
Qwiklabs, Kaggle, Coursera,

and LinkedIn, there
are only about 300,000

global professional data
engineers, data scientists,

and ML engineers today.

Yet, at the same time, there's
huge demand for data engineers

and ML engineers in the market.

According to Coursera
market research,

in just the past
12 months, there's

been over 200,000 job postings
requiring data engineering

and ML engineering
skills, and that demand

has been trending upwards.

Over the past three
years, there's

been a 91% increase in job
postings requiring these skill

sets.

Many enterprises are
still in the early stages

of data platform
modernization and AI adoption

and are really struggling to
find data engineers and ML

engineers to make this happen.

To bridge the skills gap, Google
Cloud learning has brought some

of the best of Google
together, its top engineers,

it's solutions and expertise
in building large scale data

and machine learning systems
to produce two industry leading

certifications in the job
market, the professional data

engineer and
professional ML engineer.

These certifications are
not just about Google Cloud

technologies.

In fact, the initial stages of
designing each certification

are product agnostic.

And just like the
real world examinees

are expected to
know the vast amount

of foundational concepts, design
patterns, and technology trade

offs that they may encounter
in their day to day jobs.

So how have these certifications
been received by learners

and recognized in
the job market?



Think of Google
Cloud certifications

as valuable tools to
validate your learning

and help you build your career,
get promoted, and earn raises.

In a recent survey of Google
Cloud certified individuals

conducted by an
independent third party,

we heard some incredible
pieces of feedback

from learners across the job
market on how Google Cloud

certifications have enabled and
boosted skills for Cloud roles.

78% of respondents
were more confident

when talking about their
future opportunities

after certification.

82% of respondents felt
proud to have a proof

point about their
skills and abilities

when working with recruiters.

83% of respondents told us
they felt more marketable.

And finally, 85%
of respondents just

had the boost of confidence
that they both wanted

and needed to really
get themselves out there

for Cloud opportunities.

So in short, if you're asking
yourself, what's in it for me,

I hope these anecdotal
shares and statistics drive

home how learners
like yourselves

have benefited from Google
Cloud certifications.

Next, let's take a
look a little bit more

closely at the
value propositions

for the professional data
engineer and ML engineer

certifications.



First, let's talk about the
professional data engineer

certification.

A professional data
engineer is the enabler

of data driven decision making
by collecting, transforming,

and publishing data.

This is an intermediate
professional certification

that requires three-plus
years of industry experience

and one-plus years
designing and managing

data solutions on Google Cloud.

We offer a data
engineering learning

path with hands-on
practice through Qwiklabs

that culminates in a
two hour multiple choice

and multi select exam
to validate your ability

to design, build, and
operationalize data processing

systems.

Upon completion, you earn a
shareable credential and gain

access to Google Cloud
community, swag, and events.



So why do I think you should
get certified as a Google Cloud

data engineer?

Data engineering is a
challenging applied discipline

that is best learned
through practice.

Through following the
recommended learning path,

you will complete 30 plus
hands on data engineering labs

in a sandbox GCP
project environment

to practice building
and deploying

data processing solutions.

Further, the Google Cloud
data engineer certification

was recently named
as the number one

top paid global IT certification
according to global knowledge

market research.

You will learn some of the
most valuable and in-demand

enterprise skills
in the market and be

indispensable to organizations
modernizing their data

platforms and looking to
adopt machine learning.

Third, you will learn data
engineering best practices

from Google, which brought
Hadoop and Beam to the world

and currently processes over
2.5 exabytes of logs per

month on planet scale
compute in network.

Through this certification,
you will differentiate yourself

for career success by learning
how to choose the right data

storage and processing services,
identify the right balance

of trade offs for
various data workloads,

and practice implementing
production tested data

processing design patterns.



To prepare you for the exam,
we designed a learning path

that covers foundational
data concepts

and data pipeline design
patterns as well as

steps you progressively through
key data ingestion, storage,

and data transformation
services on Google Cloud.

For aspiring data
engineers, the learning path

is designed to be completed
in about three and 1/2 months

and about five hours per week.

For existing data engineers,
the Coursera preparation

certificate is
still a great place

to start to learn Google Cloud
data services that you can then

supplement as needed with
additional hands-on practice

through Qwiklabs.

I recommend the certification
to ML engineers, as well,

and personally started
my certification journey

here first.

Data management
and data processing

are key foundations of modern
production ML pipelines.



Now, let's discuss the
professional ML engineer

certification.

This is a more
advanced certification

that also recommends three-plus
years of industry experience

as a data scientist or
machine learning engineer,

including at least one
year designing and managing

machine learning
solutions on Google Cloud.

A professional ML
engineer designs, builds,

and production houses ML models
to solve business challenges

using Google Cloud ML services
and knowledge of proven ML

models and techniques.

So why do I think you should get
certified as a Google Cloud ML

engineer?

The Google Cloud professional
ML engineer certification

is continuously updated by
leading Googler and industry

subject matter experts to
best reflect the ML engineer

skill set in the job market.

This gives aspiring and
current ML engineers

the opportunity to validate
their expertise in machine

learning in Google Cloud against
a rigorous, practical industry

benchmark exam recognized
in the job market.

Google is a globally
recognized leader

in AI research and
applied machine learning

with over a decade of
experience productionizing

machine learning systems as
part of applications serving

billions of users per day.

Google Cloud is the
platform by which

Google delivers this pioneering
ML research and product

solutions to customers.

In fact, Google
Cloud's AI platform

was recognized by Gartner as
an industry leader in its 2020

Magic Quadrant for Cloud
AI developer services.

My key takeaways on the ML
engineer certification for you

all are this.

The Google Cloud professional
ML engineering certification

is a rewarding learning
journey for you

to build your development skills
on an industry-leading data

and machine learning platform to
both differentiate yourself as

well as position yourself
for success in the rapidly

evolving field of
applied machine learning.



The learning path is designed
to augment your study

through a structured progression
of role based curriculum

through Google
Cloud fundamentals

through applied machine learning
and up to ML ops content.

It's designed to be completed
in about four months

at about six hours per week.

The content is
available on demand

through a Coursera professional
certification certificate

with additional hands-on
practice opportunities

available through Qwiklabs.

For aspiring ML engineers,
I have two additional tips

for you.

First, take advantage of $300
in free credits in the Google

Cloud free tier on products
such as the ML APIs AutoML

and BigQuery to start building
ML applications today.

Second, learn
socially and publicly.

Form a study group to share
your learnings and projects

with others.

GitHub, blogs, or the
Google Cloud learning forums

are a great place to start.

I personally like open
source contributions

to projects, tutorials,
and documentation.

Take a look at open issues on
some of your favorite email

projects like TensorFlow
and Google Cloud samples

tagged as help-wanted
or good first issue

as an approachable
place to dive in.



Lastly, I'd like to share
with you all of what's

coming next for Google Cloud
data and machine learning

training.

It's an exciting time to be
building data and machine

learning solutions.

So far in 2021, Google Cloud's
already industry leading data

and machine learning
platform has

seen its most significant
enhancements in the past two

to three years.

In the June 2021 data summit,
Google Cloud engineering teams

laid out their vision
for the data cloud

with new services like
Dataplex and Analytics Hub

to bring new data management and
analytics sharing capabilities

to enterprise data teams.

Together, along with new
integrations between BigQuery

and Booker, data engineers can
focus on further breaking down

organizational data silos
to more broadly socialize

insights across organizations
to enable business value.

Furthermore, at
Google IO in May 2021,

Google Cloud
announced Vertex AIs,

the successor to AI Platform,
a unification of services

such as AutoML and
custom training

for developing ML
solutions faster.

There are over 20-plus major
updates and net new services

reaching GA over the next
year, particularly related

to ML ops, opening up
fundamentally new ways

to build and deploy ML
solutions and incorporate them

into decision making systems
to deliver business value.

Vertex AI, BigQuery,
and Looker, as well as

AI industry solutions empower
data scientists or data

engineers and ML
engineers with new tools

to close the data value gap
while enhancing development

and productivity, the ability
to scale your workflow

and your decision
making with your data,

as well as accelerating
time to value.

My colleagues and I in
Cloud Learning services

are hard at work bringing Data
Cloud, Vertex AI, and industry

solutions content to you
through Qwiklabs and Coursera.

Stay tuned for
significant new data

and machine learning
training rolling out

in the second half of
this year as well as

a major update to the
professional ML engineer

certification for Vertex AI
in the second half of 2022.

Now, I'm keen to switch over
to the Google Cloud console

to share with you some of the
new capabilities of Vertex AI.

Welcome to the Vertex AI
ML development platform

in the Google Cloud console.

To get started, first
enable the Vertex service

in the API and Services tab.



Vertex AI is a platform
that contains services

for each phase of the ML
development lifecycle,

from data sets to
predictions, enabling

you to go from experimentation
to production ML

workflows to delivering
business value faster.

The Data Sets tab contains
a list of all your data

sets in your project with
support for image, tabular,

text, and video data types.

Manage data sets enable you to
create a link between your data

sets and your models for
traceable and reproducible

experiments.

You also get descriptive
statistics on your data set

as well as the ability to
configure automatic or custom

data splitting.

The Notebooks tab contains new
features such as Managed Vertex

Notebooks.



Vertex Notebooks are interactive
JupyterLab development

environments that enable
you to quickly build custom

machine learning solutions.

They provide support
for multiple frameworks

flexible compute and easy
access to accelerators

like GPUs and TPUs.

They also have newer,
tighter integrations

with key Google
Cloud data services,

like Cloud Storage and
BigQuery in a single window.

Check out some of the newer
integrations with Data PROC

as well, which also
makes Vertex notebooks

a great single window for
development of Apache spark,

as well.



In the Training tab you can also
see and create your training

pipelines using the same
managed data set for both AutoML

and custom training jobs.



You can leverage pre-built
containers with your model code

with frameworks like TensorFlow,
Scikit-learn, PyTorch,

or XGBoost.

For maxima; flexibility,
you can also

leverage custom containers, as
well, leverage in any framework

you'd like with any
additional dependencies,

upload it to artifact
registry, and use it

for model, training, prediction,
or as a pipeline step.



AutoML is a great way to quickly
build highly accurate models

with built-in support for
standard evaluation metrics,

feature attributions,
quick model deployment,

as well as metadata that
covers the model architecture

search as well as the
hyperparameters that

were searched, as well.

In the Experiments tab, you can
create a managed TensorBoard

instance to organize and compare
model performance across model

runs and data splits.



For predictions, you
can deploy new endpoints

for online predictions
or scheduled batch jobs

for bulk predictions, as well.

A model can be deployed
to multiple endpoints

or can serve multiple
models on a single endpoint.

With multiple models on a single
endpoint and traffic splitting

capabilities, you now have some
new model prediction evaluation

capabilities, such
as A/B testing.

For production ML workflows,
the new Vertex pipeline service

enables you to automate,
monitor, and govern

your machine learning systems
by orchestrating your tasks

in a serverless manner.

Clicking into an
individual pipeline run,

you have a graphical
user interface

to view and debug each
step of your workflow,

from data set creation,
model training, evaluation,

and deployment.

You can expand
upon your artifacts

to be able to deep dive
into individual pipeline

runs and their artifacts, such
as model evaluation metrics.



In this example, you also have
a conditional model deployment

step, which you
can use to ensure

that you're only pushing
higher performing

models to production.

This concludes a
quick walkthrough

of just some of the new
features available in Vertex AI.

I encourage you
to also check out

services like data labeling,
ML metadata for tracking

your development artifacts
across your project,

as well as the upcoming
Feature Store, which

enables you to reuse
features across ML use cases.

For hands-on on practice in a
Google Cloud project with some

of the features I just
introduced, check out

the Vertex AI labs on Qwiklabs.

A great place to start is
the Vertex AI Qwik Start,

where you will walk through
an end-to-end custom training

workflow on Vertex AI
to train and deploy

a TensorFlow model to predict
customer lifetime value.

To start your data and
machine learning engineering

learning journeys today, check
out our recently launched

Google Cloud Skills
Boost, our new destination

for Google Cloud learning with
over 700 labs and courses.

This will be available to you
all the entire month of October

free of charge.

It's never been a more
exciting and productive time

to be building data systems and
doing applied machine learning.

Thank you for learning with us.
